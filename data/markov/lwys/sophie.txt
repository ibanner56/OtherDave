Bye! Sure. 
Todd?! If the Time Cops got Todd, then the Captain should have the paperwork.  
Oh! Um, hi. I volunteer because I want to make the world a better place. 
...Are you bragging about a misdemeanor? 
Sophie. Nice to meet you too, Todd. And, for the record' I think it's really cool that you spray painted a cop's face. 
MY PENDANT! WHERE'S MY PENDANT?! 
Finally taking up the piano? 
Todd? Hi! Are you... a Forkco guy? 
Well, no thanks. I've got way too many forks as it is. 
...Oh' Oh wow. Thank you. It's a... family heirloom. 
Make it tea and you've got yourself a deal. 
Hey Todd! ...How do you know my dog's name? Are you' okay? Will you... excuse me? 
Let's suppose I did pause time' why aren't you paused? 
God is such a strong word. I, like, control the flow of time or whatever. Just this dimension. 
Ever had a day that seems like it drags on forever? That's me. 
Anomalies aren't usually so' handsome. 
Do you just exist outside of time, or'? 
Sounds paradox-y. So, why haven't I heard of you? Usually everyone shows up for the Christmas party, at least- 
Wait' you do have a time passport, right? Oh, god, please don't tell me, what, are you some kind of time crime? 
It was nice knowing you, Todd. But, your very existence- we could both get locked up for ten eternities for this. 
Oh, Todd' Todd! I' I thought tonight we could watch all of One Piece. Being able to speed up time has its advantages. 
And, well... When are you going to introduce me to your other selves? 
Of course I do! I wanna know all of you. Especially the creepy-old-person you. It's not everyday you get to find out exactly what you're signing up for! 
You must be Oldie! Hi! 
This is so much better than baby pictures! Nice to meet you, Babs! 
Oh, I get it. If Babs likes me, does that make you like me more? 
Huh! Kinda creepy, if you think about it! 
Nice to meet you! I guess you do, being that you're Todd, after all. 
So, wait. Does that mean you and I have- It begs the question' if you and I slept together now, would that technically be cheating? No guilt either way! 
I'm sorry, Todd. I was definitely flirting with Tomo. 
You gotta cut me some slack, though. This situation is confusing, to say the least. 
I know. I could rewind time if you want. I've got infinite do-overs! 
Everybody's complicated. Let's be complicated together. 
Well I think they're delicious. Thank you, Oldie. 
Did somebody put horse blinders on the baby? 
Don't you have work? 
I'd love to! Yeah. Ladybugs. 
Or I could have paused time. Lucky for us I can slow down time! 
This? ...My mom left it to me. In a way, yeah! But it's not magic - only I can use it. 
It's got something to do with my connection to it. And because of that, the further away I get from it, the less control I have. Bad signal. 
This is a little embarrassing actually. I thought it fell in with the garbage we picked up so I spent that entire afternoon picking through the dump. 
...and that entire night. And the next morning. Do you have any idea how fast time moves when you can't control it? 
Where did you find it, anyway? Maybe it was fate. Todd! 
That was just the bank.  
Oh! You finally got it?? I'm so relieved, honestly. Without that, I' well, I just don't want this to end. 
How'd your picture come out? Everybody always looks tired for some reason. 
See you tomorrow! Best hot dogs in town. ...Did they say why? 
I can't be with a time crime, Todd. And the only other option would be... 
I understand. I'm glad you didn't. Please. And as your friend, I'm gonna do everything I can to help you get your Time Passport. Someday. 
That part isn't gonna change. That part isn't gonna change. 
Sooo, uh' how have you been? Oh. Yeah, me too. Yeah, bros. Play some football, hit the showers. 
Oh, geez. Right! I'm here to help you study! 
Ohh, fun! Given your situation, you've probably seen quite a few paradoxes, right? 
Paradox Control Theory is a way to explain how paradoxes can occur without disrupting the flow of time. 
Think of this entire dimension - everything that has ever and will ever occur - like an old record. Time itself is simply the needle on the record player. 
So all time exists at once, but the way we experience it is linear like the needle running over the grooves of a record. And some people, like me, can control the playback. 
Now here's the tricky thing. When a paradox occurs, it creates an entirely new record and replaces the one being played. 
Paradox Control Theory states that the old record warps and spins into uncontrollable disarray, resulting in infinite untold misery as every lifeform within it flashes excruciatingly in and out of existence. 
The Time Bureau has all this stuff figured out. 
Sure, but- A group of people live shackled in place their whole lives, facing a blank wall. 
They see the shadows of objects passing behind them and believe those shadows are reality, even though they don't accurately represent the real world. 
Sounds like you've got a pretty good handle on it! 
What is this place? Todd, wait! What is this place? Come on, Todd. Let's get back to studying. Sh-shouldn't we get back to studying? Time law ain't no joke! 
Todd, you can't do this! Look, the theory, it's really old, ok? People believe a lot of different things. 
I- I don't know. Knowing you makes me wonder about a lot of things. 
Were you really gonna destroy your whole family to get out of a test?  
Okay, take this with a grain of salt, but It's the exact same as this dimension but everybody has wet orbs for bananas. 
That's propaganda! Today's the big time passport exam! How ya feelin, champ? Nonsense, you got this. Remember, we gotta keep it professional once we're in the metaverse. 
As an unlicensed anomaly, you're super illegal. 
None of that. In here, we're not even friends. You're my charity case, got it? Knowing you, it won't be easy. 
Right, ok. Starting now. 
Alright, you take the stairs and I'll meet you up top.
You gotta have a Time Passport. We'd both get arrested if you came in here. 
Finally! I've never had to take the stairs. Was it really that hard?  
Alright, let's get to the testing office. Todd? 
Alright, this is the testing room. I've got some meetings in the city while you take your exam. Meet at the bottom when you're finished? And good luck today. 
Professionally. I'm- I'm sorry! He's- it's for charity. His other selves are his family. No! What? No! I'm sorry. Sarge, no! You can't just kill Todd! 
Sarge, Shut up. Whatever you did right doesn't matter anymore. 
You thought?! You got me taken off the field, man! And do you really think you're eligible for a Time Passport now that you've got a record?? 
Of course it does! I hate to leave it like this, but you have to go. Now. 
Yeah, Todd. I think it is. Please take care of Petey. 
Oh Petey, you're such a good boy! 
No way. I'm already in enough trouble.  
Oh! I'm the new assistant. Guess I won't get too comfortable. 
Aha! No'! Todd, I'm so sorry' Wait... 2019?? 
You lied about that anomaly you bagged. I know that anomaly. 2019 was before I even met Todd. I don't think you did. ...Deal. 
Thank you! Mind if I join you? 
What! What's not to like about me? 
Thanks. It was almost my 125th year. 
Hey, Food-o-mat! Hey E6. Sophie. Okay, I am definitely picking up on a vibe with you two. 
There you are! I, er, didn't see you at lunch. 
Listen, if this is because I suggested you and your partner are interested in each other, Well, then I'm sorry and you're welcome!
