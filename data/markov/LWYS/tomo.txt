Looking for something? 
I knew you'd try to take all the batteries for your silly toys. So I took them all first. 
Oh, I'll give you batteries. ...But you've got to do something for me. 
Batteries are all well and good, but how would you like infinite power? 
Then you'll go down to the sub-basement and trip the breaker. 
I think we both know who has the power in this relationship. 
Not too close there, friend. 
I'm sorry things didn't work out, but I'm happy to pay you for your service. 
How's one battery sound? 
As I suspected. 
Soon, Oldie' Don't you see?! 
I control the batteries! Nothing else matters! 
You really think you can beat me with that thing? Because I don't think you can. 
Then the people will have to come and take them.  
You... really think... you can beat me? 
What do you think happened to my eye? 
Power always wins. 
Well, that was fun. 
My birthday was yesterday. 
You're here now, aren't you? 
No, this can't be. 
These numbers are different! 
Are YOU? Oh yeah. 
You don't forget a face like that. 
So there's no butterfly effect. 
Just replace the network card. 
Mmhm. Don't forget to install the virus. 
I'll always cherish this day. 
What do you mean? I feel fine! Who cares? 
It's not my cat. 
That's a bit much, Oldie. 
We know, buddy. I did the same thing. 
Don't worry. I already found us a new job! 
So sore. I don't think we were meant for manual labor. 
Yeah! But I think we can make this work. 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! T-TAKE THE DAY OFF?! OH, SURE. I'LL JUST TAKE THE DAY OFF. AND LET EVERYTHING WE'VE BUILT FALL APART. 
It's overheating and the fans are overcompensating by defying the laws of physics. 
Maybe you should take up jogging. 
Sorry, buddy. And miss the show?
Ahhhh. So this wasn't a nightmare. 
Step away from Babs. Dad, stop!! 
I'm Todd! ...Yes, and... he's me, too. 
Dad! What happened, Dad? 
What's the last thing you remember? 
Something like that. We're not exact on the math. 
Oh, I dunno. Three years? Maybe a hiatus in there? 
That's weird' Babs never cries.  Here, let me take him.  
There, there, buddy. That's our dad! 
Isn't that exciting? Heh, guess he just' hasn't seen his old man in a while. 
You feel pretty at peace with that whole thing, right? 
Well don't worry about it, buddy. You were just having a nightmare. You did. 
Leaving already, huh? 
Not this part.
Dad, don't go Dad! 
Let's get you cleaned up, kiddo. 
I've got it on good authority that you peed your pants. 
Come on, kiddo. Let's get you changed. 
Do not hit send. Because I have ten thousand notifications from people informing me that I'm a bad person. 
They're calling it pandagate. And the people who aren't angry at me are angry at pandas. 
There's some really hateful stuff here. Someone literally wrote a thinkpiece about it. 
I'm not saying you shouldn't explore ideas and try to find your own truth. I'm just saying maybe it's not worth having that conversation with the entire world.
Come on. We'll do some panda research together. 
Like a thousand but I'm telling you, these people really only care about hating pandas.  
Oldie, what are you doing?! Oldie!! 
The earthquake is gonna hit any- Get Babs!! We've got bigger problems. 
I saw this yesterday and I still don't believe it. I don't think there's anything we can do, Todd. 
It's every parent's nightmare. Get in a doorway! Earthquake!! 
Honestly, what can we do? It's every parent's nightmare. 
Oh, kid. We gotta do something about... This. 
Honestly, no. This is breaking my heart. 
Don't worry, Spike. I'll help you fix your look. 
Boy' he's been in there a while. 
Young man! You've slept in till noon! 
It's called personal responsibility. 
Alright Spike, let's get you some cool clothes. Anything stand out? 
See, this is why I'm here. 
Our goth phase was' I have a thousand copies, old man! 
Not cool. Decidedly not cool. 
We're trying to make you less nerdy, remember? 
How about something from here? 
Good! Cool people don't need to think. 
Here, try these on. 
Is Spike still mad at us for trying to fix him? 
You actually seem less cool. 
Me too. It won't happen again.  
Hey, nice job in there. 
No, Todd - look! Babs is back! 
I really wish you wouldn't do this. 
Yep. Somehow I doubt it. Nope. 
Well, we gotta do something. 
That guy is starting to get weirdly comfortable. 
Todd, obviously that would be an amazing show. 
But no! These bloodsuckers have taken enough of our money over the years. Let's take a stand. 
Oldie, how do we know what happens in Romeo and Juliet and you don't? 
Will you relax? The date goes great. 
What! That's dumb. 
Okay, okay! Be cool, here she comes. And she brought Petey! 
Lucky guess. Say you're fine. 
Dammit, Todd! How is this even remotely my fault? 
Some date, huh? Interesting, though! I mean, it's not every day you meet a time god. 
I bet she'd see you if you filed the paperwork, at least. 
So this place exists outside of time, but it still takes 8 weeks to process?? Whatever. 
Funny, feels like I already know you. Oh yeah. 
And since I only have Todd's memories I wouldn't even remember! 
Kinda already feels like we're dating if you ask me. 
The only way we can be sure any of us are coherent around you is if Babs can't see you. 
Don't blame me! I'm as disappointed as you are. 
Shave less? Strong drinks put hair on your chest, not your face. 
Uggh' Yeah? What? Why can't Todd do it? I dunno, man! 
I didn't actually see any of this happen. I'm a little out of my element here! 
I'll just' go out there and talk to them. Logically. Well, so what if they're technically sporks? They're the same forks you liked having yesterday! 
Okay, okay! If you're not satisfied with your sporks I can...offer a partial refund. Hooo, alright'  A full refund'? 
I hope you're happy, Todd! We're bankrupt. And it's your fault. If you had just shown up for work, I'd have known what would happen and could do something about it! Or Sophie could have paused time! Your laziness cost us everything. 
Wait, shut up. Your bad excuse gives me an idea. Sophie, could you rewind time to 11 this morning? 
Friends, these are forks. The next generation of fork is designed for ergonomics and handling of a greater variety of foods. What you have' ...Is Fork 2.0.
Oldie, how would you like to be remembered when you die? 
I dunno. I guess as a lovable goofball with a heart of gold? 
Does' does anyone know you've made these? Well, how are you going to be remembered for your pet portraits if no one knows about them?! 
Sure, sure. Live a good life. 
Hi, I saw your ad looking for artists? Great! Sign me up for next month! 
Alright Oldie, open your eyes. It's your pet portraits! On a billboard! 
I was gonna give you a real art show, but the cafe said your paintings didn't 'match the vibe in there.' 
Oldie, you're forgetting the person your portraits touched the most. ...Me. 
Oh, um'I could never choose. They're all so' Impactful. 
I know what you're thinking. I'm screwed. 
Sophie thinks we're getting the Time Passport next week, right? Well, get a load of THIS! I made a counterfeit! 
There was a problem at the passport factory. We hire an actor to tell her that her passport is fake. 
You don't need to worry about a thing, bud. I've got it all planned out.
What's that on your face? Oh, you didn't tell her yet? Well, don't worry, you're gonna lie. And I've got it all planned out. 
Look, we're the victim here. We didn't ask to get denied for a Time Passport. 
Things have been hard enough around here. Babs has been crying all day! 
I've got it all worked out. Hey, you started it! I'm just making it work. Baaaaaagh'! 
Then why are you doing it this way? IT'S OVER, MAN! Why's she so uptight about this time law stuff anyway? Who cares?! 
I am tomorrow, you fool! 
This sucks! I hate feeling! There's gotta be something I can do! 
Help me cover Babs in never-feel gel. I don't see why it wouldn't work on a baby. 
Check this out. We'll leave Babs in front of a 24 hour news network for the rest of his life. That should leave us emotionally numb! 
You hear about the new war? I'd be happy about it if I could feel, which I also cannot. 
Do you remember any of the good times? Same. There were good times though, right? 
Todd, I'm sick, Todd. But I figured it out.  
Just drink this OJ and I won't get sick in the first place. 
No, Todd! Soup is temporary! 
We can stop this before it ever becomes a problem! 
Damn you! You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way? 
Come on, Todd! Just drink the orange juice! 
No, Todd - ! Coff - pfft - Tod- COF! STOP! It's gonna work. 
The code is 69420. Nah, I just remembered from yesterday. 
Th-This isn't what's supposed to happen! 
Then it's a good thing you've got a friend who's an expert on the mechanics of time. 
Why not? Shut up, I remember. She said she'd help you, didn't she? Plus I already invited her over. 
Big test today. 
You want an egg? How would that be a paradox? Calm down, man! 
A disc golf tournament! Oldie, didn't you used to disc golf professionally? 
Too bad. With that reward money we could afford a Gamestation 7. 
Oldie, didn't you used to disc golf? Wow, I didn't realize disc golf was such a big deal. 
That's Bubus! Wow, I didn't realize disc golf was such a big deal. 
Style points?! This guy may have been tough in your time, but he's just a little kid now. 
You can take him! You just gotta make 16 points and you're all caught up. 
Got any of those pro moves left? Of course you can. You've been on fire all day! 
You can take him! You threw a frisbee that started a fire before? 
Surprise! The Killening Come on, let's play! I've been dying to since yesterday. 
Oldie is a little' intense. Sure, sure. About time! ...Todd? Hah! Too easy. 
Wait, are you- How is this my fault?? 
Because Sophie and the giant sign that said 'don't go in here' weren't enough, right? 
Face it, Todd. When you make a decision, it doesn't matter what anybody else says. Not even your own future self. 
I'm pretty sure she's in another dimension entirely. We need to make it sexier. 
There. I'm so happy for us. Wait till you see what we've got planned for the wedding. 
N-Nothing. No way, man. That's just cold feet. Oldie says we can't afford heat since the divorce. 
It would just be so' easy. STOP THAT! I have a gray hair. I don't know! It's gotta be something you're doing! 
Not if I can help it. They're caused by stress, right? So we just gotta get Todd to relax, that's all. 
We're going to the spa! And I'm paying! It's working! My gray hair is almost gone! 
We just need to get you more relaxed! The most relaxed you've ever been! 
Nonsense. Do you have any more' in-depth packages available? 
Perfect. He'll have that. 
Now that is relaxed. 
Gray! But how?? You're right. I should accept that we're getting older and handle it with grace. 
We've always had a boat. Ever since those gruff but kindly fishermen saved us as a baby, remember? 
It's been a pretty good life, hasn't it? On the sea?  
To be honest, I wouldn't want it any other way. 
If we find Babs, we're just rescuing him from this. 
Todd, please! The only person we're hurting on our quest for revenge is ourselves. Oldie died! Look, Babs is safe! No scar! Let's call off the hunt. 
Do you mean why did I stop cleaning up after you? Because I'm tired, Todd. 
Yesterday's Tomo tried to be clever about this and invented 'Itris, God of the kitchen'. Vengeful. It was a whole thing. So let's skip it. 
Just clean up after yourself. 
OHMYGOD IT'S BACK. M-Maybe if we just clean up in here' No. D-do you think it's enough? Maybe I should regrout the tile.  
Yeah' I only kind of did this! I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. We have to destroy the kitchen. I'll clean this up. Itris was my idea, after all. 
Yeah, yesterday. It's pretty good. Wow. It must be hard to be so stuck in the past. But I think this will warm you up to it. 
Nope. Thought you should learn your lesson. Todd, I can honestly say this is the best idea you've had in a while. 
Todd, you are going to sleep with Hattie. I think it's a great idea. Good luck tonight. 
H-Hattie! I'm busy! I'm still not over it. 
Let's not do the beach. 
But I became the Bee King. 
I think I know just the thing. 
Let's just get out of here. 
AGH! THAT'S IT! You are so much worse than I remember. 
Hello again, Professor Fixit and Professor Fixit. It is me, Todd. I am very prepared for the big exam. 
Lemme guess, you're raising a cow in order to create the perfect hamburger. This is dumb.	 
Why did you name him?? Cows don't eat junk food. Yeah. Grass.
What is wrong with you? Of course I did. Nice. You could say that. Very cool. 
Just because we're not cool anymore doesn't make me any less arrested. 
Please don't. Maybe I should handle this one. 
Guilty, your honor. 
Remember the time I got a cavity filled and then it came back the next day? 
Therapy is like the dentist. If I do it, I'll just forget tomorrow and it won't do anything. 
It's gotta be you. Good luck!
IT'S GARBAGE DAY! 
I don't know! I-I can't remember anything!  
I remembered why I was sick this morning. 
NO. You stop that. You stop that immediately. 
W-we're not even qualified! 
What?? Alright, let's just... Observe him for a bit, I guess? Looks like he's going into the barn... 
2 graves? But what about the other one! 
What was the machine supposed to do? You said it didn't do what it was supposed to. 
So what was it supposed to do? Try us. 
What the hell is going on? Of course. 
C'mon. Let's get you some breakfast. 
Todd! You gotta shower, man. Look at me! I STINK! I DO! That's why Oldie always looks like that. 
OH BOY. I WONDER WHY I CAN NOT FALL ASLEEP. SURELY TODD CAN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. 
Okay, listen up. I'm like this now because I got a FASHION MODELING CONTRACT. 
Because in a few days, YOU'RE gonna get scouted by a fashion agent in a coffee shop. And all you need to do... Is act NATURAL. 
Seriously, don't mess this up for me. I can't go back to the old ways. 
Oldie, you've only had the NEW ways for like a minute! 
No... H-heyyyyy buddy. How ya' feelin'? Healthy? Good, uh... good job. You did good. How about we get you some fresh air, huh? 
Don't worry, Oldie. He'll eat the cabbage. Just eat the veggies, Todd, and you'll be out of there in no time. 
Geez, it's just cabbage. How long could he possibly hold out? 
Todd, stop eating junk food. You're making me fat. 
YOU TELL ME! Look, even Babs is getting fat, and that makes no sense at all. And don't even ASK about Oldie. 
Here, eat this. Ooohhh.... ...You'll EAT it. Wait wait wait... Did any of this actually happen? Okay, but that's not actually gonna happen, right? 
Let's hit the beach. I'm feeling a little pale. 
Why are you wet? Have you been swimming?
What?? This doesn't even add up to 100%! It adds up to 120%! Well maybe if we just all give it 120%, it'll work out. Yes, that's why I'm taking it. 
TODD!! You have to stop immediately spending our paychecks on dumb useless stuff. 
Oh yeah? What's this then? The latest MechoNeko figure?? You call THIS a necessity? 
Okay, enough nonsense. From now on, every time you get a paycheck, I'm taking half of it. It's called saving for the future. And I'M the future. 
Well, here we are again. Todd... buddy... You remember THIS, right? Eh?? Eh??? What's the password to this?? I DON'T REMEMBER EITHER!! 
I got it! Let's show him the spot where it all began. YES! Where he fell into the vat of laughing gas! 
Just have to check his location history for where that place was. Uh oh. I don't remember the name of the street I grew up on. 
I do! Maybe we could show him stuff from his past to help him remember? 
What about the barn cats from episode 27 
Well what about that goth phase Oldie went thr-- 
Well then what can we show him?? Somehow my head hurts just looking at this. 
You okay there, bud? Looks like you took a tumble. 
No. I'm still not over it. 
She's going for the 3! How foolish! She must be hoping I play the 1, but I have TWO cards that can beat the 3. It doesn't even matter which one I play! 
WHA-- HOW--B-BUT- THE 3!! HUH?? She's already made her choice?? Well it's not the 3. What rotten luck! The one card that could beat it. Again not the 3! 
That has to be a 1, 2, or 5. Time to bring out my own 3! YES!! Back to even! Actually. 
She owes ME $500. I'm listening. Hmm... How about... YOU use this set. I'll use the other. 
What else is there to do in the woods? 
Let's literally never speak of this again. 
Hm... it seems to... Slope downwards? 
Huh. W-what?? We have no idea what's down there! If you wanna go, you go yourself! 
Hmm... But then by that logic... Boy, we sure have had a rough couple of days, huh? Y-yeah! Are rocks wholesome? I guess rocks are kinda wholesome... 
That's a moth. 
Wait. Hold up. Scroll back up. Huh? Okay, hit me. Tsk tsk. I know everything you're gonna do, remember? Care to try again? 
Huh? Does he think he's gonna pull me down with just a little tug?? 
Y'know, I have no idea what Todd got me this year. 
Ugh, it's not me. It's Todd. He keeps getting into bar fights over anime girls! 
Atta' boy. Because it's >>HEALTHY<<. And it'll help Oldie live a long time. You want Oldie to live a long time, don't you?? 
Because today you can have The Health Goop. And tomorrow you-- I mean, I, get a cupcake. 
Everything in moderation. 
NO YOU DRINK THE HEALTH GOOP! You see what happens when you don't drink the goop. 
You can call me Tomo, actually. No, I'm not To-- Well, actually, I kind of >>AM<< Todd, but I'm separate from T-- But at the same time, it's kind of li-- 
Well, uh... No. I'm not Todd. That's none of your concern. What >>is<< your concern... Is that right now, you're the only soul in the world that knows of me. And if any of this ever gets out... especially, say, on a little cryptid forum. 
Hey Professor, let's chat. 
Sure, I've got time for a round. 
Yeah, almost like that. 
Well, see ya' later. 
Maybe you could beat Babs! 
Hehe. It's for your own >>SAFETY<<. 
Well, maybe I could prevent it somehow? Well, maybe I could prevent it somehow? 
Okay, I won't worry about it! 
H-huh?? W-what are you talking about. 
Okay, I'll go down this way, and you go that way. 
Hm... Wharton... Dostoevsky... Clearly a learned man. 
Well, I wouldn't worry about it too much, buddy. In my experience, the past can only disappoint.  
Oldie! The lamp needs new batteries!
Power's back. Who cares about batteries?   
I guess it was just kinda building up inside of me all this time.   
Listen, it won't be easy'   
GUESS I'LL JUST WORK UNTIL THE DAY I-   
Quit it, Oldie. You're being creepy.   
Well, don't worry about it, buddy. You were just having a nightmare.
