We made it, Babs!
I'm so sorry. I haven't been a good me to you.
Do you guys remember our parents?
Didn't that place shut down?
No, I- ! I think you may be right.
Why didn't Tomo mention this?
None in the fire alarm either!
I know! Tomo's taser always has batteries.
We just gotta be real snea- Fine.
I just wanna play my GameKid.
And if I don't?
Phew. Just Oldie's tooth mannequin.
I tripped the breaker, Tomo!
We still don't have power!
One battery won't even power the GameKid for ten minutes!
This isn't over.
Forming a rebellion. What are you doing?
I think I found him.
Oldie... come close.
That must be the guests!
Thanks for coming, Professor!
Now that everybody's here, we can really get this party started!
And I just started crying.
Sure, it's sad when you say it that way.
The only people I spend time with are my brothers and my boss.
Orange juice on the rocks.
And a new friend if you've got one back there, ha ha.
I'm' trying to make a friend.
My therapist suggested it.
Some bartender, huh?
Or shakedown, hustle, bamboozle or con me?
What! So did mine!
Does this count? Since we kind of know each other?
So what do you like to do? Other than grift innocent people with your wit and wiles, of course.
Oh, uh..I don't really like talking about that stuff. Thought experiments and paradoxes kinda' wear me out.
Ok, sorry. That was awkward.
I've got one. What would you do if you were split into four parts, where each one is yourself from various times in your life?
The lottery! Huh, never thought of that. I'd get my baby self obsessed with money and let the butterfly effect take its course.
Yeah, I guess it was- Er, would be.
This isn't mine!
Are you sure you wrote them right?
Well did the same guy win yesterday?
Why isn't this working, Oldie?
Well, that's not the only way to win the lottery.
I'll take all of your lottery tickets.
Was I really that bad before?
You're putting a cat in a tree!
So, what, you're evil now? Murder definitely isn't casually evil.
It's just' Do you ever get the feeling that manufacturing problems that we profit from is ... wrong?
I think all the little bad things I do are making me' casually evil.
I keep telling him that.
If this business is gonna make me evil' It's a business I can't be in. So long, Professor.
Well, guys' I quit my job. What are we gonna do?
Is it possible to break a muscle? Because I think I broke all mine.
What smells worse than I do?
Only three jobs in today's help wanted - Rock pusher, bear massager, and' ...insurance.
The only thing I've ever been good at is fixing computers. ... And the Fixit corporation owns every repair shop around here.
It's no use. We'll be broke in a month.
What if we start our own computer repair shop?! Hell yeah! What do you think, Oldie?
Er' Are we still on for bowling next weekend?
Silly Oldie. Today's Tuesday, remember?
I KNOW THERE'S TOO MUCH WORK! DOES IT LOOK LIKE I DON'T KNOW THERE'S TOO MUCH WORK?? I hate to say it, but I think we need to start turning down work.
What's going on? So you're out of a job?
How's it going with Mrs Fish, Mr. Customer Service Coordinator?
Don't teach them to Babs.
Tomo, how's the mystery of the floating PC?
Don't worry, Professor. We'll win this war from the high road.
Hattie! You got community service too?
Spray painted a cop's face.
Community service, huh? Same. I spray painted a cop's face.
I - I didn't - Uh' It's just ' Wh- Who needs cops anyway, ya know? Well ...see ya.
Oh God, I blew it! Hattie, you gotta help me! That woman' she's so beautiful!
Y-You're beautiful too! Stunning! WILEY!
No! There's something different about her. She might be my' ...SOULMATE!
I'm Todd. Nice to meet you, Sophie.
But' I didn't even get her number!
HEY! I gotta go find Sophie! 
She's' gone?? This happened to you too!
Why didn't you warn me?! You know, doc?
I feel pretty good. I'm making better decisions and I feel less' ...bad-brained. You know?
I found an old photo of us' and, well... I think maybe that's enough for me.
Sleep tight, Babs.
Did one of you guys order foo- I' I guess, yeah.
I think I peed my pants.
Wha' was... Dad here?? I' I guess, yeah.
...Why was I sleeping on the ground?
I think I peed my pants.
I' I guess, yeah.
Ugggh, I've been on hold for forty-five minutes!
If only I could- Time baby!
Babs, pull my phone back in time!
That way my call will be the first in line.
I'm not giving up that easy!
I'm getting through to somebody if it's the last thing I do!
Alright, not worth it.
Down here, Professor!
Professor Fixit said he was bringing a friend.
I am not playing with her! She can't be trusted! She's always bamboozling!
What about Tomo?
Fine! But only because this means so much to Oldie.
Hey, Profe- Oh come on!
How do you even know Hattie?! Of course you do.
It means you always do whatever you want to whoever you want!
You brought HER?! She's evil! And she's always grifting!
You stole my soulmate's pendant!
How do you even know Hattie?! What about Tomo?
Fine! But I don't trust you.
(To Hattie) But only because this means so much to Oldie.
Of course you do. It means you always just do whatever you want!
Maybe this hotel is locked up for a reason!
Did you know she stole my soulmate's pendant?
Are they' ...vampire sheep?
Ah, Hathildis! Thank goodness you've come to save me!
What about stealing the villager's blood?
That was great, Oldie!
Same time next week, guys?
Oldie, do we ever find time to play Figments and Fantasies again?
What! Why not?? My 27 followers deserve my unfiltered question bombs!
So what, you want me to censor myself?
Hmm... maybe you're right.
Whoa, how many followers do we have now?
I think it's a flying squirrel. Poor thing.
AHH! It's alive! Kill it!
What do I do what do I do what do I do Don't worry Babs, I'm comi- Oh.
Are you seeing this?
What's happening to Babs?? We gotta do something!
What do we do?? Okay, well we have to stop this, right?? So' Babs is a teenager now?
So, what do we call you? ...Teen?
Plus, imagine how awesome we'll be if we were this cool when we were teenagers!
And I'll help you fix your personality!
Of course you do! You wanna impress Stacy Shaffer, don't you?
To be fair, you only got up an hour ago.
Well you look cool. How do you feel?
That's because you don't know the rules of cool.
In order to be cool, you have to not care if people think you're cool.
See, this is exactly what I'm talking about. Relax! When people say mean stuff to you, let it slide right off.
That's the spirit! No more anime. Not anymore! Now you love sport!
So rebellious He's a natural!
Yeah. He won't come out of his room.
It's weird, I kind of expected that we would get cooler after we fixed him, but I feel the same.
Hey Spike' I know you're mad at us.
I would be too. I was so used to you being my little 'me' baby.
I guess I just wasn't ready for you to grow up so fast. And I'm sorry.
You sure can, buddy.
Oh thank God.
And yet, I will!
I'll just be gone for a few hours, buddy. no time powers.
Did you feel another earthquake last night?
Oldie, what's going on here?
This most definitely has not always been here.
In fact, it's only half here now.
Yeah, but something tells me I don't stick with it.
No, Professor. Remember that massive debt I told you about?
I was 18, okay?! Anyway, I kinda stopped paying them when I opened the shop and' H-How did you find me?
Maybe if we just ignore the debt, it'll go away.
Then I'll just get rid of the debt before I get it in the first place.
So basically, if someone tries to get you to pay them for a job, it's a scam.
Do you think that worked?
I don't understand. If we warn Babs in advance, shouldn't we know better than to buy into Forkco?
It was my destiny to fall for a pyramid scheme?
How's the math coming, Oldie?
We can barely afford the minimum!
I got it! Let's sell our life rights to someone who wants to make a wacky animated series! I wanna make a deal.
Thank you, Mrs. Fish. We'll have your computer fixed by tomorrow. And, before you go- Can I interest you in a set of forks today?
Eyes on the prize, Professor. We're only selling forks because we have to.
What were you talking to him for?! No he is not! I'm your boss.
These earthquakes are happening because I have Sophie's pendant? But why?
The only way to stop the timequakes is to fulfill my destiny as a door-to-door fork salesman?
I can't believe I'm a door-to-door fork salesman.
Are you noticing more 'anomalies' lately?
I heard he's been protecting the city ever since MechoNeko retired.
Just in time. I made us dinner.
I guess we'll just have to throw this food away.
Has this ever happened to you?
What? Okay, sorry. You're right.
Just in time. I made us dinner!
Fine. Fine, I'll sell forks door to door with you.
O-OH! Sophie, hello! M-Me?! Um' no! I'm just ' helping my friend!
Okay, well! Guess I gotta go' sell forks.
Wait, Sophie! Would you... like to get coffee sometime?
Well? What do you think? Is it too much?
I'm nobody's sexy half-brother!
And I'm way too nervous. I'm just gonna cancel.
Okay, yeah, that's reassuring.
But just to be sure, Bluetooth in and coach me through it.
You said it went great, right?
And since you've already experienced it, you'll know exactly the right things to say! This is dumb.
Sophie! Hi! You brought Petey!
What! Oh. Real nice, Tomo.
Did you just' pause time?
I usually save this for the third date, but I'm a time accident.
Wait' are you a time god?! All time?
Yeah? That's so cool!
No, I'm split into four different times in my life who all exist at once.
Oh, I didn't even know' Time passport?
Well, I don't know if I'd say' Can't there only be one eternity?
What do you mean?! You told me the date went great!
Yeah, well, she doesn't want to see me again.
Not without a time passport, whatever that is.
How did you do this?! Sophie, I don't even know what a time crime is.
But I've never felt like this before.
And my future self filed for a time passport.
I know it's not technically- I hate this.
Selling forks. I feel so dirty.
I'm seeing her again tonight, in fact.
You are so cool. Wow. 12 hours of anime in 2 minutes.
You really are my dream girl.
Th-those guys? You don't wanna meet those guys.
Even the creepy-old-person me?
Alright boys, Sophie will be here any minute now.
She's meeting you for the first time, so' Do not embarrass me tonight.
Oldie, what the hell!
Sorry about him, he's a little' sentimental.
Well, I definitely didn't want you to meet Oldie first, but maybe my adorable baby self will make up for it. This is Babs.
Hum, it's, you're, he's' This might be a little awkward, but' Sophie, meet Tomo.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST DATE TOMO IF WANT A PERFECT SEXY EXPERIENCED ME SO MUCH!
Oh, please don't date Tomo!
I knew this was gonna be weird, but' Nah.
Then you'll just see the infinite ways I can overreact.
Sorry about that. I was so worried about those guys embarrassing me that the raging jealousy caught me by surprise.
I know this is complicated, and... I understand if you want to leave forever.
Oldie's not much of a cook.
Well, I'm not much of a cook, so I never wanted to learn how to cook, so Oldie's not much of a cook.
Tomo, I've decided I'm gonna grow a beard.
I know some people go through an awkward pha- WHAT!
You look exactly like you always do!
Your beard! It's so luxurious! Shave more? Strong drinks?
So we have to wait till we're old to be able to grow a beard?
It's such a beautiful morning! Let's just spend the day together.We could pause time and stay in this perfect moment forever.
Actually this is kinda creepy. Well, we can still hang out all day.
Professor Fixit will be fine on his own.
What's the worst insect?
Tomo?? What are you doing here?
What?! How is that my fault?! It's not laziness, it's love!
So what if I'd rather spend the day enjoy- Now that was fun.
What's the deal with your necklace, anyway?
Oh geez, did she'? Nevermind, we don't have to talk about that.
So what's the deal with the pendant, anyway? Like, do you use it for time control stuff?
So you couldn't rewind time that day you left it in the park'?
Come to think of it, why did you leave instead of staying to look for it?
Faster than I'd like.
Oh! Uh, by the beach.
Guess it was just lucky. Maybe.
Her name is Sophie.
He's not hotter than me.
Why would I lie to my girlfriend?
Some museum! They didn't even have dinosaurs.
So, I wanted to talk.
About my time passport' Right, my' well' They just gave me a temporary card so there's no picture.
B-But the real one should arrive next week!
Did you draw me? What am I gonna tell her when she points out that this is obviously fake?
What if I actually need to use it?? So your plan to stop Sophie from breaking up with me is to just lie to her more and more?
This wouldn't work even if you were good at it.
Oldie?? What happened to you?
I became a politician because I lied to my girlfriend?? I think I need to come clean.
It'll be fine though' right?
Right, Tomo?? You don't understand!
Even if I could get away with all this, this isn't the kind of relationship I want to have.
Well, this isn't where I wanted to do this' My time passport got denied.
The form just said 'paradox-bait.
I want to be with you, but- the boys are my family.
Boy I' kinda wish I just kept lying to you about this.
Can we still be friends?
And someday- Before this ends-Can we pause time right here?
Just for a minute.
While we're still in love.
I'm never eating hot dogs again.
You know, she never actually said the words 'break up.
M-Maybe we're technically still together.
I don't need to grieve!
This will be sorted out tomorrow and Sophie and I will picnic under the stars.
Isn't that stuff for teeth?
Huh. I guess I do feel some permanent numbness. But it's physical.
How do we destroy every trace of feeling inside of us?
Sounds like it'll be a big one.
Finally, I feel nothing.
No. My brain chemistry simply doesn't allow it.
The best, probably.
Dunno, didn't feel it.
Sophie wouldn't have left if we bought her more flowers, I bet.
My love life may be in shambles, but at least business is good.
Great job today, buddy!
Well, that wasn't here this morning.
We can't compete with these prices. They're even selling spoons!
Professor, you've gotta talk to your dad. Ask him to call off whatever he's doing!
My love life may be in shambles, but at least business is good.
Great job today, buddy!
That wasn't there this morning.
These prices' Professor, we can't compete with these.
I dunno, but we can't compete with these prices. There's no way he's making money on this.
Professor, you've gotta talk to your dad for me! Ask him to call it off! PLEASE! This is all I have!
How do they even make ceilings this high?
Well, we gotta try.
Nice to meet you, sir.
We don't have to do this. Let's just get out of here.
Do you have a little brother I don't know about?
Was this Babs?
But he usually pulls things forward in time, not back.
Must be something to do with this' Well, luckily Babs' powers have a pretty short range.
Your dad will probably go back to normal once we leave.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Everything about this gives me the creeps.
Professor, that is a terrible idea. What are you gonna do, raise your dad yourself? In my backyard?
Because you have your own life to live, my dude.
...you okay, Tomo?
Ohhhhh, no can do, compadre. I don't drink orange juice. Too sour.
I've got a better idea. I'll make you some soup!
Soup it is! I'll be back in five minutes!
Think you can just force orange juice down my throat, huh?
Well two can play at that game.
Too slow. You really are sick.
Luckily I've got just what the doctor ordered.
AH HA HA HA HAAAA Ohhhhhh. This is how I got sick, isn't it.
That's why I've assembled you here. Because you're the best of the best. Even with a crack team of this caliber, this mission will be damn near impossible.
Let me have this, Tomo.
Of course it is.
Did you really hack this thing?
I did it! I got the card! But' how are there two cards?
And it's all ours.
Let's just say' I have no idea which is which.
You can just leave packages at the front door.
Finally! I got the stuff for the Time Passport exam!
This is the study ? There's no way I can get through it!
Tomo, you studied this, right? Okay, so you just explain it to me and I won't need to study.
There's quantum theory in here Tomo. I don't even know what that is!
No way. It's awkward! We broke up, remember? We cried for ten straight days?
Good! Great! Never better, even.
It's, uh, cool that we can be friends now. We're, like, bros.
Anyway, I should really study for this test' So, this right here. I can't wrap my head around Paradox Control Theory.
But you can't actually see any of this, right? How do they know that's what happens?
So every time the boys cause a paradox it creates a dimension of infinite suffering?! Every second Tomo is alive is a paradox!
And don't even get me started on Babs! I'm raising myself!
Oldie has technology from his own time! How?? Infinite suffering.
So every time we make a paradox, we create a universe of infinite suffering.
And since the boys and I are all paradoxes all the time, we cause infinite infinite suffering.
Will you excuse me? I have to go... wash my hair.
You shouldn't have come here. This is where it all started. And this is where it's gonna end.
This is where it all started. Don't you see, Sophie?
If the boys don't exist, we aren't hurting anybody. How can I live with myself knowing what we are?
Are you kidding? I don't care about the test anymore.
Every paradox I'm a part of causes infinite suffering. How can I live with myself knowing that?? There's only one thing to do.
More security than I remember.
So you're saying that every time the boys and I create a paradox, we cause infinite suffering?
Will you excuse me a minute?
Is that a paradox?! Because you're a paradox and if you didn't exist I'd have to make my own egg.
Sorry, I think I'm just nervous for my test today.
Nobody. do. anything. Everything we do is a paradox! Even sitting here quietly is a paradox!
Of course I am! Every paradox we make creates a parallel universe of infinite suffering!
So' we're not creating infinite suffering?
It didn't work?! Why not?
What if the boys are just holding me back? I wouldn't even need to take this dumb exam.
And if it's making me a bad person too?? So why is it in the book?
Come on. Let's get back to studying.
It was for the greater good!
What's the deal with this banana-eye dimension?
Sorry, I got lost in your bananas.
More security than I remember.
Oldie?! But... infinite suffering! The time lasagne... Max.
Whoa! We got a Gamestation?!
I can't. I've got all this work to do. Why don't you play with Oldie?
Let me just get through this and then I can play.
Alright, here we go. Focus. Time to focus.
No way. I've gotta get this done first.
NOT TODAY, SATAN!
Finally. I can play video games.
I hope you're ready to get schooled by Huh?
Come on, let's fire this thing up!
Although if you wanted to pause time for a week or three so I could study... I think we've struck a pretty good balance. As, like, exes.
I'll avoid flirtatious banter at all costs.
Hey, now you're doing it!
Whoa! It's so big and sci-fi!
What!! How come you get to take the elevator?
No problem. Can legs die?
Thank you, from the bottom of my professionalism.
Alright, finished. This exam is in the bag.
I PASSED! Eh, close enough.
I've basically got my Time Passport.
Wha-WHAT?? This is all a big mistake!
I just passed my time exam!
Sophie! Great news, I- The stairs were really hard, I just thought- Does that mean we can't' So this is... goodbye?
You could've warned me not to take the elevator!
So Sophie's definitely done with us, right?
Yeah. I think I'm gonna start dating again.
Why aren't we getting any matches?
Our bio is perfect!
I got engaged!
What was that?
Is everything okay, Oldie?
B-But you're pretty old!
If the marriage lasted that long it couldn't have been all bad!
Okay, so I'm starting to think we might be... rushing into this a little.
Why is it so cold in here?
Tomo, I think we might be rebounding a little.
And that's why we need to break up.
I hope we can still be friends.
Wait, Rachael! Could I get that ring back?
Oh no, no, no.
You think it's from cutting carrots?! Relax.
Sure. Maybe I'll just go for a nice walk.
I dunno, Tomo. I'm pretty relaxed.
Tomo' Tomo!!!! How?! Did you ever think kidnapping me and paying some guy to beat me up might be a little stressful?
Besides, it's like Oldie said. It happens to everyone eventually.
Hell no! Someone is running vaguely negative ads under our name!
I'm pretty sure you're a sociopath.
What are you even doing here?! Actually, we might be able to use this.
Hattie, do you still work for Fixit Corp?
So you can be our spy!
Go in there and tell Jack you're on the payroll.
He'll have to trust a fellow Fixit!
You mean aside from the forks you already stole?
I said you can keep them!
Were you planning to pay for those?
Hattie, do you still work for Fixit Corp?
I'm pretty sure you're a sociopath.
Okay, we're not doing that.
But I think I've got a better plan.
You're back! How did it go?
Wait, you're keeping the job?
N-No! I've seen the way you grift people!
You working for Jack is way worse for business than vaguely negative ads!
W-Well, what if you worked for me?
And you give my bag back.
Oldie, is this the biggest sandcastle we ever make?
Hey, has anyone seen Babs?
Right. Of course.
Tomo,  how did we get this boat?
Right. Of course. Sure has.
Thar she blows.
Today I will have my revenge. MY REVENGE!
On the great whale who ate me as a baby.
The whale who gave me this terrible scar.
I'll kill you!
Why is the kitchen so dirty?
I guess, yeah.
You mean that thing?
Nice try, daddio.
Todd's got video games to play.
Did you' Perfect.
Oh, stop. It looks great.
And hey, you got what you wanted!
Guess the plan wasn't so bad after all.
Oldie! What happened?! Well, that's it.
I'm getting rid of this stupid thing.
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?! Didn't your Tomo figure this out?
How did you get rid of it before?
Thanks, Tomo, but' I think we should clean it together.
Finally. The first Belts for Gloves album in ten years.
Anime Dream. Have you guys heard Anime Dream?
Wow. It must be hard to have such bad opinions.
It doesn't sound anything like their old stuff!
No, forget it!
I'm not gonna have a story arc that easily!
In fact, I'm so upset that I'm gonna tell Belts for Gloves exactly what I think!
That'll show 'em.
Huh! You know, I've actually been listening to Anime Dream this whole time.
I guess I kinda like it after all!
The letter! Please tell me you somehow stopped that.
Okay Babs, today you're gonna take this $4 bottle of wine' And age it 20 years!
Thus creating delicious, vintage wine.
I know, I know. It's stupid, right?
Wh-what?! This one was $3. And voila! Now it's worth $300!
Professor and Hattie are coming over to do a little tasting. And if it's good? We sell it!
Wine tastings, weddings, funerals! Anywhere with people looking for a good time.
Professor just canceled, so' Well, it's just.... It's too much wine for just us!
Oldie isn't my dad.
Oldie, wanna get drunk on wine?
Looks like it's just you and me.
Remember, this is a tasting.
We sort of' made this wine.
It worked! It's even better than I thought!
So I said, I said - Asuka.
Of course, right?! But th' guy loves Rei, so he yells Rei!
Nex' thing I know I'm in a fistfight.
Did you ev'r think we'd wind up as friends?
After how we met?
Sounds like you were never done with me.
Fun?! Yeah. Not too much fun! Just, uh, just the right amount. Of fun. Just the right amount, though! Nothing more!
We should probably all just... get to work.
Hattie, could I talk to you in my office?
Listen, about last night' People?
Thanks, Hattie. How did you find out...?
It may not be MascotWorld... But it's been great spending time with you today, little buddy.
Me neither. It's like my memories are ' corrupted.
I remember having them, like the echo of an echo.
That was our only lead!
How are we gonna find my parents now?
I' I think I grew up here.
But I don't remember... anything.
I' I think I grew up here.
But I don't remember... anything.
If this used to be my life' I don't think it is anymore.
Tomo was right.
The future is all that matters.
Who needs a crummy old flashlight when you've got a GameKid?
Fine, you've got the batteries.
I only need fifteen to make my GameKid work.
You literally know the future!
Wanna join my rebellion?
Only willing to support the rebellion for a paycheck, huh?
Get outta here, scab!
I'd hate to think what might happen to your little lapdog if you don't give me the batteries I need.
Call the hospital.
Well how come you've never turned casually evil before?
So, this is a truffle farm?
Do I just walk around and pick mushrooms?
How did you find out...?
Tomo' maybe you should take a day off, buddy.
Well, this is no good.
How would you like to come work for me?
Only problem is, the barn isn't big enough for all of us.
You stole my soulmate's pendant!
It's a big change, but I guess I've accepted the fact that Spike isn't our little baby anymore.
Geez, he really likes anime.
What, like destiny?
Besides, that stuff is impossible.
I think I'd remember that, Tomo.
Didn't you clean up?
Shot of espresso, G-Great!
Give me a call whenever!
Let me help you with that.
Here you go.
Maybe I'll see you around sometime.
It's nothing, Oldie.
It's just... I'M SO ALONE.
You gotta tell me, Oldie!
Do we ever fall in love?! Even being in love for a little while would be better than a lifetime with just ...me.
Professor Fixit got into a fist fight with some guy named Bernard at work!
I got the day off!
Let's hit the beach.
I'm feeling a little pale.
We didn't have any sunscreen, but I brought moisturizer!
Let's see' unit 305.
Weird place for a dinner party.
Oh, hey guys.
Yeah, I just don't think we've met.
Whoa. Did Babs just kill a guy?
I made a casserole!
Cleaning out the attic isn't so bad.
Especially with my little helper!
Let's see' old weight set. Keep it or toss it?
My prom suit! That's a keeper.
Whoa! Tickle Me Tough Guy'! I used to love this thing!
Oh' you wanna try, Babs?
Heh, that's cool.
Just a kid's toy anyway.
Not like I'm overwhelmed by nostalgia or anything.
Goodnight, old friend.
I love you, too.
Morning, Professor Fixit.
Which I am absolutely prepared for!
Excuse me for just one minute.
I'm not cheating, I'm preparing!
Tomo is me!
If you don't mind, you're making it hard to study and I've got an important exam tomorrow.
P- Professor Fixit?
They're all JUST OKAY.
Let's see' breadcrumbs, garlic, and' The blood of a freshly slaughtered beast, personally named by the chef?
I think you know full well that's what we're doing.
Oldie's cursed recipe book said we had to.
We've tried everything!
Oh yeah, genius?
What do cows eat?
Grass is basically salad.
This is gonna take forever!
Well, Buckley' I guess this is it.
WHAT HAVE I DONE?! Buckley!
Well, it may not be the perfect hamburger' But I can live with it.
Tonight's the high school reunion, Oldie!
NOT SO BAD?
Don't you remember how uncool we were in high school, Oldie?? Nice.
Oh, uhh.... Oh, hey Stacy. Long time no see.
Pretty good, huh?
I'm sorry, Stacy. I have to go.
It'll never be the same.
Well sure, it sounds dumb when you say it that way.
Well, I didn't do it. NOT GUILTY!
I'M out of order?! The whole system is out of order!
I don't see why I have to go to therapy when you're the one who's got a bad brain.
Well? How'd it go?
Food for thought.
Well, thanks Oldie.
Maybe I'll take over next week.
Well, maybe if I do it you won't have issues in the first place.
Besides' I know you didn't get all those teeth legally.
I'm flattered, doc.
Breakfast is great. Thanks Oldie!
TOMO, NO! How could you forget?! You gotta catch up to them!
I can't do it, it's' Then I guess it's up to me.
ow ow ow Well Doc, I ' don't really remember my parents anymore.
I was mostly raised by my, uh, brothers.
They were really cool.
But they' ...Alone.
Babs! Have I told you I love you today?
Hm. I still feel insurmountable loneliness.
I know! What we if take a little day trip together? Just you and me!
MascotWorld is so fun, Babs! You and me are gonna really bond today.
How about some tunes? You like this one, huh? Me too.
Oh, geez. Traffic's really backed up.
We could be here for hours.
We'll never make it to MascotWord at this rate.
I'M GONNA DELIVER MY APPLICATION RIGHT TO THE POST OFFICE!
Why do you want to be mended?
So what? Do you know what the cult you've gathered around yourself calls you?? The GOD OF FISSURES.
They think that that crack on your head is ALL YOU ARE.
And now you too define yourself by your brokenness.
But that's not all YOU.
You're clearly some sort of 3 eyed... ...tentacle... ...thing.
Yeah you should see how busted Oldie is.
Look, I don't know who or what you are.
But you've kidnapped my friends, invaded my dreams, and attracted a cult.
What is it that you WANT?
I think Oldie might be evil!
Well, the old MechoNeko is evil... ...so the OLDverse must be the EVILverse.
Oo! Look! He's coming back out! With a shovel!
O-one for each of us!
Phew! I wish it was what we thought.
MECHONE-- Hey Oldie!
Exciting day today?
Oh I bought eggs by the way!
Good morning, sleepy-head!
NO!! NOT MY GOTH PHASE!!!! HA!
YOU CAN'T GET ME OUT HERE!
YOUR GUN DOESN'T HAVE THE RANGE.
H-huh??... Soap? The rain... is soap?
Well then why don't YOU shower?
Make me. Oh, we're doing this again huh.
P- Professor Fixit? Morning, Professor Fixit.
Which I am absolutely prepared for!
Excuse me for just one minute.
I'm not cheating, I'm preparing! Tomo is me!
If you don't mind, you're making it hard to study and I've got an important exam tomorrow.
Goodnight, old friend.
I love you, too.
Cleaning out the attic isn't so bad.
Especially with my little helper!
Let's see' old weight set.
Oh' you wanna try, Babs?
Heh, that's cool. Just a kid's toy anyway. Not like I'm overwhelmed by nostalgia or anything.
I have to do this. For MechoNeko.
What did you think of my fight, MechoNeko?? He really had me in the ropes in the beginning, but I got 'im in the end!
Well my love for you is real!
*GASP* This is it! This is a second chance from God to impress MechoNeko!
... Do you have any idea how much coffee I've had?
It's like it was going slow motion for me.
I guess I just have to sit here, like Tomo said.
This must be the fashion agent. What do I do?? But how do I act natural?? Do I introduce myself? Act aloof? Ask who he is?
Oldie, help! Tomo is STYLIN' ON ME!
I can't eat that. It's on the ground. It's got GROUND STUFF all over it. Look, there's even a bug on it. Disgusting.
Aren't you just a few days older than me? How are you getting fat?? Well I don't see how that's my problem.
I'm not eating this. This is an entire cabbage.
I-is that some sort of incantation to get rid of him?
You realize I'm gonna see you at work tomorrow, right?
He should be here any minute now.
Anyway, sun's going down.
They should be showing up soon.
So what do you have to get rid of these guys?
I saw them last night.
Buncha guys in robes?
They were humming, I think.
Yeah I don't remember doing... ...stocks... Professor Fixit got into a fist fight with some guy named Bernard at work!
I got the day off!
We didn't have any sunscreen, but I brought moisturizer! 
We're been putting money in House Fund for a week now.
There must be so much in there.
I'm gonna go swim in it like Scooge McDuck. Crying.
Look, whatever happened to living in the moment?? Wouldn't you rather have money NOW than LATER?
You'll NEVER do it!
You'll NEVER make me be financially responsible!! I'm gonna go spend my whole paycheck on Boritos and video games!
I don't! I-I only spend on the necessities.
WHAT?? BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR!
YOU'RE NOT THE GOVERNMENT!! I remember.
Am I being kidnapped?
A baby! A baby of... ...whoever you kidnapped it from?
HEY TOMO, CHECK THIS OUT!! ... Are you?
I have no idea what just happened.
My application got lost.
So I had to insert myself at the last second.
Even being in love for a little while would be better than a lifetime with just ...me.
It's nothing, Oldie.
It's just... I'M SO ALONE.
You gotta tell me, Oldie!
Do we ever fall in love?! Shot of espresso, G-Great!
Give me a call whenever!
Let me help you with that.
Here you go.
Maybe I'll see you around sometime.
YOU OWE ME $500!!!
W-wha-- Oh, Babs?
He's at home.
What do you need Babs for?
No, we just kinda, uh... ...Found this?
We should go down there any check it out!
No, you should go.
Well it's simple: If anything happens to me, it'll affect you immediately.
But if anything happens to >>YOU<<, I'll still have a day to rescue you before it affects me.
Yeah! Time for a wholesome episode!
Let's go hiking in the woods! We're bound to see lots of wholesome things there. Like snails! And mushrooms! And rocks! Yeah! Streams! Butterflies! Flowers! A big, spooky cave! Caterpillars!
B-Back to the cave?
Uh, b-basically... We might have unleashed a big, possibly evil, hyper-intelligent AI onto the internet.
Oh, look. It's Tomo.
We have to call Tomo.
Tomo, I-- Just a second!
I'm taking care of him today.
What is it?
Wow... it improves that fast, huh?
Babs, I'll just leave you right here for a minute~ You might be me... But remember.
>>I'M<< also >>YOU<<.
YOU GOT IT, CHIEF!
I about into an argument about Asuka vs. Rei.
First of all, why do we even have a framed picture of Oldie!
And second of all I saw that cupcake you put in the fridge earlier!
Why do you get cupcakes but I get The Health Goop. YOU DRINK THE HEALTH GOOP!
NO FAIR! IT'S LIKE YOU KNEW EVERYTHING THAT I WOULD DO!! OLDIE!
PLAY WITH ME.
Ugh... this is such nonsense.
HEY OLDIE!! I NEED SOME HELP OUT HERE!
Damn. Looks like he's showering.
Maybe I can get up there?
Um, Tomo... I think there was a squirrel with a knife outside Stay back!
I'm not afraid to USE THIS!! Damn it.
WHAT'S EVEN THE POINT?? A sweatshirt, a cactus, a computer?? Anything, I'll get them, they'll know.
Unless... I MYSELF don't know?
DAMN IT. WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLE BE.
Oldie!! You've >>GOTTA<< know, right?? Why is Tomo so happy right now???
Y'know what, maybe it doesn't matter.
Maybe I don't need to know.
Whatever it is, it's gonna happen anyway right?
Hmphghghphhgh... mgphghph... So why was I even worried about it to begin with!
What the absolute hell Tomo.
But Tomo is NEVER happy.
But that could only mean... SOMETHING HAPPENED!! ALRIGHT, SPILL THE BEANS, TOMO.
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
DON'T PLAY DUMB WITH ME.
AM I GONNA WIN THE LOTTERY?? AM I GONNA GET A PROMOTION?? Am I gonna eat a really good pastry?
Fine! Play dumb with me.
I'm just gonna sit >>RIGHT HERE<< until the good thing happens.
Tomo, I've got an idea!
What if instead of just >>me<< going to work... We took turns!
You know, if >>I<< wasn't so overworked, maybe >>you'd<< less tired too.
Good morning, Professor Fixit!
Y'know, we shouldn't have included Oldie in the rotation.
Lex... Lex, I didn't know... THAT YOU WERE SUCH A HUGE FAN OF MECHONEKO!
There are some people I'm willing to forget for.
Wooow! A personal spa... Well! Don't mind if I do!
OW!! WHAT THE HELL?
This is the place! I'm gonna knock on the door!
HELLO?? UNCLE LEX?? Like, we'd better go snoopin' around in here, Tomo!
Well, I submitted an application to be MechoNeko's sidekick.
And I've been waiting for a response for over a week!
He was supposed to fly by and drop it off by now!
Hey, Uncle Lex applied too, didn't he?
I should go see if >>HE<< got >>HIS<< application back.
UNCLE LEX! ARE YOU APPLYING TO BE MECHONEKO'S SIDEKICK TOO?
Hey, uh, would you' wanna go out sometime?
Do we ever fall in love?
OH MY GOD I NEED IT.
IT'S TOO MUCH. THE NOSTALGIA' ...MUST' HAVE' TICKLE ME TOUGH GUY' Sorry, Babs.
Professor - it's time for work.
When I was a kid, I used to love when Dad grilled.
Warm summer evenings, the crisp smell of - You saved him!
And I think Stacy Shaffer is gonna be there.
Why is your face still tagged, anyway?
Did they break your brain to bits?
They didn't really pay any attention to me.
Professor ' it's time for work.
IT'S TOO MUCH.
THE NOSTALGIA' ...MUST' HAVE' TICKLE ME TOUGH GUY' Sorry, Babs.
OH MY GOD I NEED IT.
Boo hoo... boo hoo hoo Tomo, let me outta here.

So, uh... I think we have a cult in the woods.
I think I know just the thing.
Do we ever fall in love?
Hey, uh, would you' wanna go out sometime?
Hey dude! Play this game with me.
U-uh Tomo, what's going on?
