I bet my life. You must be thinking,  Well you're right, it doesn't matter. 
Rest assured that the 3 is perfectly safe and cozy... Right here. 
Psh, Don't tell me you ACTUALLY thought I wanted you to use the set with the tear.
Don't tell me you ACTUALLY bought all my acting. 
And y'know the best part? You can't blame anyone but yourself. After all, YOU'RE the one that cheated! 
Oh... you're that-- Oh! You're that guy that bought the ticket from me! But... you two are friends?? 
H-hey how about we settle it with a game? If I win, my debt is cleared. But if YOU win... You'll get $1000. Double what I owe you. 
It's simple. We start this game with 5 cards. Each round consists of playing a card face down in front of you. Then we flip them. First to 2 wins. 
What do you say? You can use this set, and I'll use the other one. 
Well, this might not be the high seas... But a little day trip into the wild can't hurt. 
But this thing is brand new! 
Hm. Maybe they have some tools in there. 
It's all >>SO BORING<<! 
At least grifting these chumps adds a bit of excitement to my life. 
I was born in the wrong time period. I was meant for adventure! The high seas! Pioneering. Isn't that right, Mecho-Neko?? 
Don’t worry, I’m not gonna swindle you. Fine. No fraud at all. 
My therapist suggested I try to get out and meet new people. 
Well, how about this. I’m Hattie. Nice to actually meet you. 
I dunno. I think a lot, I guess. Like, okay. If you replace every part of a clock with new parts, is it still the same clock? 
Oh! Uhh.. okay. We don’t have to talk about that. 
Well, that’s obvious. I’d get today’s lotto numbers from my future self. What would you do? 
Seems a little obtuse. It’s been nice getting to know you, Todd. Let’s do this again sometime. And hey, here’s your wallet. 
You’re either stalking me or we’ve got the same judge. 
Pickpocketed a magician. The trick is misdirection. Very cool. 
HMPH! I don’t want to hear about this.  
Hello? You were nailing it with this beautiful woman. Not good enough for you? So you’re one of those ‘want who you can’t have’ types. 
You’re lucky you’re cute when you’re an ass. Did I say cute? I meant pathetic. 
Follow my lead. Hello, miss…? Sophie! This is my friend Todd. He may seem like a total badass, but let me assure you - - Todd is very sweet. And he wanted to sayyy… 
Come on, Todd. We gotta go. 
Hey! I help you, you help me. 
The trick is misdirection. Lost ‘im. 
Not sure, but the unemployment pay is insulting. 
Thank you for having me, friend. You have a lovely home. 
Are you sure this is okay? Last time I hung out with Todd I kinda… stole a pendant from this girl he liked. 
He got it back! His weird stoner twin tripped me. 
I dunno, but I’m still collecting unemployment on it. 
I try to pick the hotel’s lock. 
What’s that supposed to mean? 
Not my problem. 
Just shut up and let me concentrate. Just a little more… 
I cast decoy, making an illusionary duplicate of myself. And I shoot Todol a wink. 
No. I’m gonna level with you, Orion. The villagers at Woolsmouth sent us here to kill you for stealing their blood and making vampire sheep. 
Todol I… I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have stolen that girl’s pendant. It’s just… ever since I was a kid I’ve had to look out for myself. 
I think I push people away because I’m afraid of them hurting me first.  
Were you going to eat Todol?? 
I’ll try… I’m trying to be better. 
Yeah! Oh, I’ve got a thing! How about three Saturdays from now? 
Bye! Thanks for having us! 
So, you’re dating pendant chick, huh? Raise. 
Now that you’re off the field, what’s the deal with that weird twin you keep locked in your house? Tomo, right? He’s hot. 
So, have you lied to her yet? You don’t care about someone unless you care enough to lie to them. Maybe a white lie to make her feel good, maybe a dummy thicc lie because you’re scared. 
Rest assured, my friend - everyone is- Er, what was I saying? Oh, right. Everyone is a liar. 
Well done, Todd. Guess you beat me. Or did you? Yours is a fake, of course. I knew you’d go straight for the safe. I put the fake there to throw you off the scent. Keep it. 
I’ve grifted a lot of dorks with that card. 
Or did you? Yours is a fake, of... H-How did...? Well, you still have to make it out of my apartment. 
Awesome. Boooo! I get a paycheck, if that’s what you’re asking. 
I dunno. What’s in it for me? Fine. It’s not fun if you know about it. 
I get a paycheck, if that’s what you’re asking. 
Awesome. Yep. Correct. Great. Is that your computer? I need to send an email. Thanks. 
Could I get a little privacy? Aha! So he really has been posting vaguely negative ads about Todd’s business. 
Sorry, Jack. Alright, it’s been fun working here but- Actually, I- That’s dumb. That’s good! 
Right this way, Mrs. Fish. 
Your little problem is all taken care of, little guy. 
Yep. I’d love to hang out, but my shift doesn’t end for another four hours. 
I’m gonna make a fortune on commissions. 
Sorry, kid. I go where the money takes me. 25%. Keep talking. I can go higher. Deal. 
So it’ll just be the two of us, then? I do not care. Tomo, right? And a whole lotta wine. In that case… Whoa! Of course! 
Nah. I nev’r run into a mark by accident. Not when I’m done with ‘em. 
No, I guess I never was. 
Morning, boys. I had fun last night, boss. 
What’s up, boss? 
Not a big deal. So we got a little drunk, had a little fun. People do it all the time. I do it all the time. 
Last night didn’t mean anything. We can forget it ever happened.   
Are you the innkeeper? We mean you no harm!   
I’ll try… I’m trying to be better.   
Maybe your weird brother will join us. Or your weird dad.
