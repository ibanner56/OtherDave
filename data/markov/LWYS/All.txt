Babs? Babs? Thanks Susan. The city is under attack by dark forces yet again, this time by a giant spiderdog from the fifth circle of hell. But wait, could it be? Why, yes, it’s Supernard! The city is saved! That’s some arm you got there, kid. Not bad at all. I’m Lucas, pleased ta’ make your acquaintance. Now that we’re all friendly-like, I could use some help. See that cookie jar? Those are our cookies, but Madison won’t give them to us. Yeah! Back off! Congratulations. Fill these out and mail them in. You’ll receive your time passport in 4-8 weeks. We don’t have great white sharks. Don’t you work here? Security! Dad he says Never had one, never needed one! Let us have some, Lucas! P.F. Mystery’s Private Investigation Services, P.F. speaking Sure did. Z was right, as always. And we’ve got proof. No it isn’t. Chicken looks like the pigeon from episode 123 but chicken-y It’s just bad business. Wait, up there…! It’s… I suppose it could be used to help people, but it really is designed as a weapon first. Hello, fellas! I’m proud of you son. Take good care of yourself. I’m proud of you son. Take good care of yourself. City zoo, how can I help you? How can I help you? Oh! I don’t know. About 75? Yer job is cleanin’ the pigs. Careful. They’re strong and they don’t like city boys. We mean you no harm! Are you the innkeeper? Careful! Let me check for traps. You know what? I’m sick of this! I may be a thief, but you’re a jerk! And that’s worse! So, fine! You’re on your own! Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh. While he’s distracted, I untie Todol. I can’t take on a vampire alone! Like it or not, we’re stronger together. No. Thicker sweaters. Supply and demand. Vampire sheep… this must be where they keep them. You should fight him without me. Trust me. And genius plans, if I do say so myself. You can be my bait anytime. 5F uses a device that pauses time. Everything turns black and white except them, and a pause symbol shows up over the panel. Don’t worry, Tomo. I hope Dirtballer is prepared to split that billion dollar jackpot. I just wanna focus on being a good... ‘brother.’ See? It’s perfect. Lucky guess? Indeed. Rusty forks?? I like this setup, and I think it’s better served with a different story. Like what if they have to battle their way up the Fixit corporate building? Fighting his shitty siblings along the way? That would be so much more interesting than just meeting Fixit’s kinda nice mom. maybe the same shot of the boys but only Tomo is there and he’s giving a thumbs up and nodding. Chip and Bubus have opposite taste. Chip likes beauty and grace, Bubus likes violence and profanity. Oldie becoming master of both worlds means he has to hit both marks. HOT DOGS! One long dog, one double dog, extra beans. Yeah. It’s like, ironic. Perhaps. MechoNeko! You got a problem, Hand? he should start his own business! Tomo is already two steps ahead of him and has made a sign for the barn. Oldie tells the boys, I carved my own path and lived a good life. I wouldn’t have it any other way. Well, see ya! -beat- Oldie comes back shocked, WHY IS MY ROOM FILLED WITH BOXES OF TEETH?! Dolphins again. A… baby? Your face is on the building. We want our money, Todd. I’d hate for someone to get forked over this. How do we know which is the real Sike? Just friends, Mrs. Fixit. I can’t believe All Might isn’t dead yet. Is that everything? Alright Steven, close your eyes and let’s get you fitted for this sweater. You may feel a small pinch followed by a substantial draining sensation. For money, that’s why! When people get fitted for sweaters, I steal their blood. With less blood, they’re colder. And what do cold people need? Then I use the blood to pay Orion here to turn everybody’s sheep into vampire sheep. Vampire sheep are dangerous, so the ‘Mr. Woolesby Vampire Sheep Control Group’ gathers all the turned sheep in town. (for a small fee, of course.) Then I simply use the vampire sheep wool to create low-quality sweaters. They degrade in days, and the cycle begins anew! No. I’m a good businessman! Guards! Dispose of these communists. Silly dwarf! I control this town! At least... I died.... rich! Or did you? Oldie selects tragic: Our story begins in Woolsmouth Village on a dreamily moonlit night. You find yourselves outside the town’s hotel in search of a place to rest after a long day of adventuring. Even for night time, the streets are strangely deserted. Suddenly, a guard! Our story begins in Woolsmouth Village on a spooky moonlit night.  Even for night time, the streets are strangely deserted. You find yourselves outside the town’s hotel in search of a place to rest after a long day of adventuring. One of the sheep attacks Todol! As the three of you exit the inn, you notice that a wagon has pulled up and collected all the vampire sheep. It’s got a sign that reads Mr. Woolesby’s Vampire Sheep Control Squad Play me, Todd. Oh come on. Just one round won’t hurt. Hello sweetie! Bless my heart, hello sweetie. Oh! Is Todd your…? And who’s this little guy? Aren’t you a darling! Oh sure. You know the way to your father’s office. I’m sure Professor will be happy to see you. One thing I know about my dad is that he’s a stubborn old goat. If he’s trying to drive us out of business, he’s not gonna stop. That’s Violent Games Magazine’s slay of the year! I bear a message for you, Time Obscenity. Stone stolen, obscenity found / Now is not the time. Follow the fork. Some destinies are dumb. I’ll take ten sets of forks! I want to get married and have babies. Now. Goodbye, Todd. Aw! I wanted vanilla! taking a selfie with Spike: puts on #1 Sport hat: Remember, we gotta keep it professional once we’re in the metaverse. You’re my charity case, got it? Thank me. THANK ME THANK ME THANK ME Todd does forgive but then shoots the harpoon by accident? This is a good justification to be together without having to understand this stuff I’m kind of bad at. This guy? But he’s so... So handsome! Yes. Oh my god yes. Should I put on my good robes? Oh, who am I kidding? I look amazing. Hey, you! What do you think of these robes? Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh. I cast charm person! Hello there. Not surprised. Well, it sounds like we need to pay this Mr. Woolesby a visit. Mage hand! You two go! We’ll handle things here! You did too. But, Orion, I have to come clean about something. Your attraction to me… it isn’t real. When we met, I cast charm person on you. You knew?! I’m a vampire now! ba-kaw //www.boredpanda.com/funny-pet-portraits-charity-hercule-van-wolfwinkle/ EUGH! Babs is a baby name! Could you think of anything more dorky? Call me… ...Spike! O-Oh. Um… I don’t think I need… Ok but I gotta use the bathroom. Ohh what about here?  Coooooool! It’s really loud in here. I can hardly hear myself think! I dunno. A little silly. Oooh, structure! But aren’t I caring if people think I’m cool by trying to be cool? Why would people say mean things to me? Wh- but I love anime! That’s IT! Maybe I’m not cool, okay? So… I can watch anime again?? Innkeep! We’ve captured three Vampire Sheep outside your establishment. That’ll be 600 gold pieces. Bye! Sure. Todd?! If the Time Cops got Todd, then the Captain should have the paperwork. What do you want, Junior? For revenge, ya dimwit! Your goofball friend put the country branch out of business! Everyone at the club laughed at me. Ah, yes. My own entitled son who’s never accomplished anything in his life. I should keep enabling his behavior even though he’s in his 40s. What is there to be proud of, exactly? I’m sure you’re a disappointment to your father too. I see you like my sacred relic. It was appropriated from indiginous lands! What are you…! That’s my boy. ...Can I help you? ...No. What? Select a lunch. Thank… me? Select a lunch. We made it, Babs! I’m so sorry. I haven’t been a good me to you. Do you guys remember our parents? Didn’t that place shut down? No, I- ! Heads! I think you may be right. Why didn’t Tomo mention this? None in the fire alarm either! I know! Tomo’s taser always has batteries. We just gotta be real snea- Fine. I just wanna play my GameKid. And if I don’t? Phew. Just Oldie’s tooth mannequin. I tripped the breaker, Tomo! We still don’t have power! One battery won’t even power the GameKid for ten minutes!  This isn’t over. Forming a rebellion. What are you doing? I think I found him. Oldie... come close. That must be the guests! Thanks for coming, Professor! Now that everybody’s here, we can really get this party started! And I just started crying. Sure, it’s sad when you say it that way. The only people I spend time with are my brothers and my boss. Orange juice on the rocks.  And a new friend if you’ve got one back there, ha ha. I’m… trying to make a friend. My therapist suggested it. Some bartender, huh? Or shakedown, hustle, bamboozle or con me? What! So did mine! Does this count? Since we kind of know each other? Todd. So what do you like to do? Other than grift innocent people with your wit and wiles, of course. Oh, uh.. I don’t really like talking about that stuff. Thought experiments and paradoxes kinda… wear me out. Ok, sorry.  That was awkward. I’ve got one. What would you do if you were split into four parts, where each one is yourself from various times in your life? The lottery! Huh, never thought of that. I’d get my baby self obsessed with money and let the butterfly effect take its course. Hah! Yeah, I guess it was- Er, would be. This isn’t mine! Are you sure you wrote them right? Well did the same guy win yesterday? Why isn’t this working, Oldie? Well, that’s not the only way to win the lottery. I’ll take all of your lottery tickets. Network card. Er… right. Later, Tomo. Was I really that bad before? ...Right.  You’re putting a cat in a tree! So, what, you’re evil now? Murder definitely isn’t casually evil. It’s just… Do you ever get the feeling that manufacturing problems that we profit from is ... wrong? I think all the little bad things I do are making me… casually evil.  I keep telling him that. If this business is gonna make me evil… It’s a business I can’t be in. So long, Professor. ...Yeah? Well, guys… I quit my job. What are we gonna do?  Is it possible to break a muscle? Because I think I broke all mine. What smells worse than I do? Only three jobs in today’s help wanted - Rock pusher, bear massager, and… ...insurance. The only thing I’ve ever been good at is fixing computers. ... And the Fixit corporation owns every repair shop around here. It’s no use. We’ll be broke in a month. What if we start our own computer repair shop?! Hell yeah! What do you think, Oldie? Er… Are we still on for bowling next weekend? Silly Oldie. Today’s Tuesday, remember? I KNOW THERE’S TOO MUCH WORK! DOES IT LOOK LIKE I DON’T KNOW THERE’S TOO MUCH WORK?? I hate to say it, but I think we need to start turning down work. What’s going on? So you’re out of a job? How’s it going with Mrs Fish, Mr. Customer Service Coordinator? Excellent! Don’t teach them to Babs. Tomo, how’s the mystery of the floating PC? Super. Don’t worry, Professor. We’ll win this war from the high road. Hattie! You got community service too? Spray painted a cop’s face. Community service, huh? Same. I spray painted a cop’s face. I - I didn’t - Uh… It’s just … Wh- Who needs cops anyway, ya know? Well.  ...see ya. Oh God, I blew it! Hattie, you gotta help me! That woman… she’s so beautiful! Y-You’re beautiful too! Stunning! WILEY! No! There’s something different about her. She might be my… ...SOULMATE! Really? I’m Todd. Nice to meet you, Sophie. But… I didn’t even get her number! HEY! I gotta go find Sophie! She’s… gone?? This happened to you too! Why didn’t you warn me?! You know, doc? I feel pretty good. I’m making better decisions and I feel less… ...bad-brained. You know? I found an old photo of us… and, well... I think maybe that’s enough for me. Sleep tight, Babs. Did one of you guys order foo- I… I guess, yeah. I think I peed my pants. Wha… was... Dad here?? I… I guess, yeah. ...Why was I sleeping on the ground? I think I peed my pants. I… I guess, yeah. I think I peed my pants. Ugggh, I’ve been on hold for forty-five minutes! If only I could… Time baby! Babs, pull my phone back in time! That way my call will be the first in line. I’m not giving up that easy! I’m getting through to somebody if it’s the last thing I do! Alright, not worth it. Down here, Professor! Professor Fixit said he was bringing a friend. I am not playing with her! She can’t be trusted! She’s always bamboozling! What about Tomo? Fine! But only because this means so much to Oldie. Hey, Profe- Oh come on! How do you even know Hattie?! Of course you do. It means you always do whatever you want to whoever you want! You brought HER?! She’s evil! And she’s always grifting! You stole my soulmate’s pendant! How do you even know Hattie?! What about Tomo? Fine! But I don’t trust you. (To Hattie) But only because this means so much to Oldie. Of course you do. It means you always just do whatever you want! Maybe this hotel is locked up for a reason! Did you know she stole my soulmate’s pendant? Are they… ...vampire sheep? Ah, Hathildis! Thank goodness you’ve come to save me! Hathildis, run! What about stealing the villager’s blood? That was great, Oldie! Same time next week, guys? Oldie, do we ever find time to play Figments and Fantasies again? What! Why not?? My 27 followers deserve my unfiltered question bombs! So what, you want me to censor myself? Hmm... maybe you’re right. Whoa, how many followers do we have now? I think it’s a flying squirrel. Poor thing. AHH! It’s alive! Kill it! What do I do what do I do what do I do Don’t worry Babs, I’m comi- Oh. Everybody okay? Are you seeing this? What’s happening to Babs?? We gotta do something! What do we do?? Okay, well we have to stop this, right?? So… Babs is a teenager now? So, what do we call you? ...Teen? Plus, imagine how awesome we’ll be if we were this cool when we were teenagers! And I’ll help you fix your personality! Of course you do! You wanna impress Stacy Shaffer, don’t you? To be fair, you only got up an hour ago. Well you look cool. How do you feel? That’s because you don’t know the rules of cool. In order to be cool, you have to not care if people think you’re cool.Z      See, this is exactly what I’m talking about. Relax! When people say mean stuff to you, let it slide right off. That’s the spirit! No more anime. Not anymore! Now you love sport! So rebellious He’s a natural! Yeah. He won’t come out of his room. It’s weird, I kind of expected that we would get cooler after we fixed him, but I feel the same. Hey Spike… I know you’re mad at us. I would be too. I was so used to you being my little ‘me’ baby. I guess I just wasn’t ready for you to grow up so fast. And I’m sorry. You sure can, buddy. You too. Oh thank God. And yet, I will! I’ll just be gone for a few hours, buddy. no time powers. Adios, bambinos! Did you feel another earthquake last night? Ghost piano? Oldie, what’s going on here? This most definitely has not always been here. In fact, it’s only half here now. Yeah, but something tells me I don’t stick with it. No, Professor. Remember that massive debt I told you about? I was 18, okay?! Anyway, I kinda stopped paying them when I opened the shop and… H-How did you find me? Maybe if we just ignore the debt, it’ll go away. Then I’ll just get rid of the debt before I get it in the first place. So basically, if someone tries to get you to pay them for a job, it’s a scam. Do you think that worked? I don’t understand. If we warn Babs in advance, shouldn’t we know better than to buy into Forkco? It was my destiny to fall for a pyramid scheme? How’s the math coming, Oldie? We can barely afford the minimum! I got it! Let’s sell our life rights to someone who wants to make a wacky animated series! I wanna make a deal. Thank you, Mrs. Fish. We’ll have your computer fixed by tomorrow. And, before you go… Can I interest you in a set of forks today? Eyes on the prize, Professor. We’re only selling forks because we have to. What were you talking to him for?! No he is not! I’m your boss. Awake already? These earthquakes are happening because I have Sophie’s pendant? But why? The only way to stop the timequakes is to fulfill my destiny as a door-to-door fork salesman? I can’t believe I’m a door-to-door fork salesman. Are you noticing more … anomalies lately? I heard he’s been protecting the city ever since MechoNeko retired. Whatever. Just in time. I made us dinner. Oh no. I guess we’ll just have to throw this food away. Has this ever happened to you? What? Okay, sorry. You’re right. Just in time. I made us dinner! Sophie! Fine. Fine, I’ll sell forks door to door with you. O-OH! Sophie, hello! M-Me?! Um… no! I’m just … helping my friend! Okay, well! Guess I gotta go… sell forks. Wait, Sophie! Would you... like to get coffee sometime? Well? What do you think? Is it too much? I’m nobody’s sexy half-brother! And I’m way too nervous. I’m just gonna cancel. Okay, yeah, that’s reassuring. But just to be sure, Bluetooth in and coach me through it. You said it went great, right? And since you’ve already experienced it, you’ll know exactly the right things to say! This is dumb. Sophie! Hi! You brought Petey! You’re fine. What! Oh. Real nice, Tomo. Did you just… pause time? I usually save this for the third date, but I’m a time accident. Wait… are you a time god?! All time? Yeah? That’s so cool! No, I’m split into four different times in my life who all exist at once. It is! Oh, I didn’t even know… Time passport? Well, I don’t know if I’d say… Can’t there only be one eternity? What do you mean?! You told me the date went great! Yeah, well, she doesn’t want to see me again. Not without a time passport, whatever that is. Tomo! How did you do this?! Sophie, I don’t even know what a time crime is. But I’ve never felt like this before. And my future self filed for a time passport. I know it’s not technically- I hate this. Selling forks. I feel so dirty.  Very well. I’m seeing her again tonight, in fact. Oh yeah. You are so cool. Wow. 12 hours of anime in 2 minutes.You really are my dream girl. Yeah. Th-those guys? You don’t wanna meet those guys. Even the creepy-old-person me? Alright boys, Sophie will be here any minute now. She’s meeting you for the first time, so… Do not embarrass me tonight. Oldie, what the hell! Sorry about him, he’s a little… sentimental. Well, I definitely didn’t want you to meet Oldie first, but maybe my adorable baby self will make up for it. This is Babs. Hum, it’s, you’re, he’s… This might be a little awkward, but… Sophie, meet Tomo. MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST DATE TOMO IF WANT A PERFECT SEXY EXPERIENCED ME SO MUCH! Oh, please don’t date Tomo! I knew this was gonna be weird, but… Nah. Then you’ll just see the infinite ways I can overreact. Sorry about that. I was so worried about those guys embarrassing me that the raging jealousy caught me by surprise. I know this is complicated, and... I understand if you want to leave forever. Oldie’s not much of a cook. Well, I’m not much of a cook, so I never wanted to learn how to cook, so Oldie’s not much of a cook. Tomo, I’ve decided I’m gonna grow a beard. I know some people go through an awkward pha- WHAT! You look exactly like you always do!	 Your beard! It’s so luxurious! Shave more? Strong drinks? So we have to wait till we’re old to be able to grow a beard? It’s such a beautiful morning! Let’s just spend the day together. We could pause time and stay in this perfect moment forever. Actually this is kinda creepy. Well, we can still hang out all day. Professor Fixit will be fine on his own. What’s the worst insect? Tomo?? What are you doing here? What?! How is that my fault?! It’s not laziness, it’s love! So what if I’d rather spend the day enjoy- Now that was fun. What’s the deal with your necklace, anyway? Oh geez, did she…? Nevermind, we don’t have to talk about that. So what’s the deal with the pendant, anyway? Like, do you use it for time control stuff? So you couldn’t rewind time that day you left it in the park…? Come to think of it, why did you leave instead of staying to look for it? Faster than I’d like. Oh! Uh, by the beach. Guess it was just lucky. Maybe. Her name is Sophie. He’s not hotter than me. Call. Why would I lie to my girlfriend? H-Hello? Yeah? Why did my-? Some museum! They didn’t even have dinosaurs. So, I wanted to talk. About my time passport… Right, my… well… They just gave me a temporary card so there’s no picture. B-But the real one should arrive next week! Bye. Did you draw me? What am I gonna tell her when she points out that this is obviously fake? What if I actually need to use it?? So your plan to stop Sophie from breaking up with me is to just lie to her more and more? This wouldn’t work even if you were good at it. Oldie?? What happened to you? I became a politician because I lied to my girlfriend?? I think I need to come clean. It’ll be fine though… right? Right, Tomo?? You don’t understand! Even if I could get away with all this, this isn’t the kind of relationship I want to have. Well, this isn’t where I wanted to do this… My time passport got denied. The form just said ‘paradox-bait.’ I want to be with you, but… the boys are my family. Boy I… kinda wish I just kept lying to you about this. Can we still be friends? And someday… Before this ends…Can we pause time right here? Just for a minute. While we’re still in love. I’m never eating hot dogs again. You know, she never actually said the words ‘break up. M-Maybe we’re technically still together. Am not. I don’t need to grieve! This will be sorted out tomorrow and Sophie and I will picnic under the stars. Isn’t that stuff for teeth? Huh. I guess I do feel some permanent numbness. But it’s physical. How do we destroy every trace of feeling inside of us? Sounds like it’ll be a big one. Finally, I feel nothing. No. My brain chemistry simply doesn’t allow it. The best, probably. Dunno, didn’t feel it. Sophie wouldn’t have left if we bought her more flowers, I bet.  My love life may be in shambles, but at least business is good. Great job today, buddy! Well, that wasn’t here this morning. We can’t compete with these prices. They’re even selling spoons! Professor, you’ve gotta talk to your dad. Ask him to call off whatever he’s doing! My love life may be in shambles, but at least business is good. Great job today, buddy! That wasn’t there this morning. These prices… Professor, we can’t compete with these. I dunno, but we can’t compete with these prices. There’s no way he’s making money on this. Professor, you’ve gotta talk to your dad for me! Ask him to call it off! PLEASE! This is all I have! Sorry. How do they even make ceilings this high? Relatable. Well, we gotta try. Whoooa. How do they even make ceilings this high? Relatable. Nice to meet you, sir. We don’t have to do this. Let’s just get out of here. Do you have a little brother I don’t know about? Was this Babs? But he usually pulls things forward in time, not back. Must be something to do with this… Well, luckily Babs’ powers have a pretty short range. Your dad will probably go back to normal once we leave. Come on, let’s get outta here. Everything about this gives me the creeps. Professor, that is a terrible idea. What are you gonna do, raise your dad yourself? In my backyard? Because you have your own life to live, my dude. ...you okay, Tomo? Ohhhhh, no can do, compadre. I don’t drink orange juice. Too sour. I’ve got a better idea. I’ll make you some soup! Soup it is! I’ll be back in five minutes! The hard way.  Orange juice! Think you can just force orange juice down my throat, huh? Well two can play at that game. Too slow. You really are sick. Luckily I’ve got just what the doctor ordered. AH HA HA HA HAAAA Ohhhhhh. This is how I got sick, isn’t it. That’s why I’ve assembled you here. Because you’re the best of the best. Even with a crack team of this caliber, this mission will be damn near impossible. Let me have this, Tomo. Of course it is. Did you really hack this thing? I did it! I got the card! But… how are there two cards? I did it! I got the card! But… how are there two cards? And it’s all ours. Let’s just say… I have no idea which is which. You can just leave packages at the front door. Finally! I got the stuff for the Time Passport exam!  This is the study ? There’s no way I can get through it! Tomo, you studied this, right?  Okay, so you just explain it to me and I won’t need to study. There’s quantum theory in here Tomo. I don’t even know what that is!  Sophie? No way. It’s awkward! We broke up, remember? We cried for ten straight days? Good! Great! Never better, even. It’s, uh, cool that we can be friends now. We’re, like, bros. Anyway, I should really study for this test… So, this. Right here. I can’t wrap my head around Paradox Control Theory. But you can’t actually see any of this, right? How do they know that’s what happens? So every time the boys cause a paradox it creates a dimension of infinite suffering?! Every second Tomo is alive is a paradox! And don’t even get me started on Babs! I’m raising myself! Oldie has technology from his own time! How?? Infinite suffering.  So every time we make a paradox, we create a universe of infinite suffering. And since the boys and I are all paradoxes all the time, we cause infinite infinite suffering. Yes. Will you excuse me? I have to go... wash my hair. You shouldn’t have come here. This is where it all started. And this is where it’s gonna end. This is where it all started. Don’t you see, Sophie? If the boys don’t exist, we aren’t hurting anybody. How can I live with myself knowing what we are? Are you kidding? I don’t care about the test anymore. Every paradox I’m a part of causes infinite suffering. How can I live with myself knowing that?? There’s only one thing to do. More security than I remember. So you’re saying that every time the boys and I create a paradox, we cause infinite suffering? Will you excuse me a minute? Is that a paradox?! Because you’re a paradox and if you didn’t exist I’d have to make my own egg. Sorry, I think I’m just nervous for my test today. Nobody. do. anything. Everything we do is a paradox! Even sitting here quietly is a paradox! Of course I am! Every paradox we make creates a parallel universe of infinite suffering! So… we’re not creating infinite suffering? It didn’t work?! Why not? What if the boys are just holding me back? I wouldn’t even need to take this dumb exam. And if it’s making me a bad person too?? So why is it in the book? Come on. Let’s get back to studying. It was for the greater good! What’s the deal with this banana-eye dimension? Weird! Sorry, I got lost in your bananas. More security than I remember. Here it is. Oldie?! But... infinite suffering! The time lasagne... Max. Whoa! We got a Gamestation?! I can’t. I’ve got all this work to do. Why don’t you play with Oldie? Let me just get through this and then I can play. Alright, here we go. Focus. Time to focus. No way. I’ve gotta get this done first. NOT TODAY, SATAN! Finally. I can play video games. I hope you’re ready to get schooled by Huh?  Come on, let’s fire this thing up! Rematch… tomorrow. Got it. Ready. Probably. Although if you wanted to pause time for a week or three so I could study... I think we’ve struck a pretty good balance. As, like, exes. I’ll avoid flirtatious banter at all costs. Hey, now you’re doing it! Whoa! It’s so big and sci-fi! What!! How come you get to take the elevator? No problem. Can legs die? Thank you, from the bottom of my professionalism. Alright, finished. This exam is in the bag. I PASSED! Eh, close enough. I’ve basically got my Time Passport. Wha-WHAT?? This is all a big mistake! I just passed my time exam! Sophie! Great news, I- The stairs were really hard, I just thought- Does that mean we can’t… So this is... goodbye? You could’ve warned me not to take the elevator! So Sophie’s definitely done with us, right? Yeah. I think I’m gonna start dating again. Why aren’t we getting any matches? Our bio is perfect! I got engaged! Where’s Oldie? What was that? Is everything okay, Oldie? B-But you’re pretty old! If the marriage lasted that long it couldn’t have been all bad! Okay, so I’m starting to think we might be... rushing into this a little. Why is it so cold in here? Tomo, I think we might be rebounding a little. And that’s why we need to break up. I hope we can still be friends. Wait, Rachael! Could I get that ring back? Oh no, no, no. You think it’s from cutting carrots?! Relax. Sure. Maybe I’ll just go for a nice walk. Tomo?? Oh.  Oh! I dunno, Tomo. I’m pretty relaxed. Tomo… Tomo!!!! How?! Did you ever think kidnapping me and paying some guy to beat me up might be a little stressful? Besides, it’s like Oldie said. It happens to everyone eventually. Hell no! Someone is running vaguely negative ads under our name! I’m pretty sure you’re a sociopath. What are you even doing here?! Actually, we might be able to use this. Hattie, do you still work for Fixit Corp? So you can be our spy! Go in there and tell Jack you’re on the payroll. He’ll have to trust a fellow Fixit! You mean aside from the forks you already stole? I said you can keep them! Were you planning to pay for those? Hattie, do you still work for Fixit Corp? I’m pretty sure you’re a sociopath. Okay, we’re not doing that. But I think I’ve got a better plan. You’re back! How did it go? Wait, you’re keeping the job? N-No! I’ve seen the way you grift people! You working for Jack is way worse for business than vaguely negative ads! W-Well, what if you worked for me? I can give you 17% of every sale. 25% ?! Fine. 25%. And you give my bag back. Welcome aboard.  Oldie, is this the biggest sandcastle we ever make? Hey, has anyone seen Babs? Babs? Right. Of course. Tomo,  how did we get this boat? Right. Of course. Sure has. Thar she blows. Today I will have my revenge. MY REVENGE! On the great whale who ate me as a baby. The whale who gave me this terrible scar. I’ll kill you! No. Why is the kitchen so dirty? I guess, yeah. You mean that thing? Nice try, daddio. Todd’s got video games to play. Did you… Perfect. Oh, stop. It looks great. And hey, you got what you wanted! Guess the plan wasn’t so bad after all. Oldie! What happened?! Well, that’s it. I’m getting rid of this stupid thing. WHY DID YOU DO THIS?! Didn’t your Tomo figure this out? How did you get rid of it before? Thanks, Tomo, but… I think we should clean it together. Oldie? Finally. The first Belts for Gloves album in ten years. Anime Dream. Have you guys heard Anime Dream? Wow. It must be hard to have such bad opinions. It doesn’t sound anything like their old stuff! No, forget it! I’m not gonna have a story arc that easily! In fact, I’m so upset that I’m gonna tell Belts for Gloves exactly what I think! That’ll show ‘em. Huh! You know, I’ve actually been listening to Anime Dream this whole time. I guess I kinda like it after all! The letter! Please tell me you somehow stopped that. Okay Babs, today you’re gonna take this $4 bottle of wine… And age it 20 years! Thus creating delicious, vintage wine. I know, I know. It’s stupid, right? Wh-what?! This one was $3. And voila! Now it’s worth $300! Professor and Hattie are coming over to do a little tasting. And if it’s good? We sell it! Wine tastings, weddings, funerals! Anywhere with people looking for a good time. Okay, weird! Hattie, hey! Professor just canceled, so… Well, it's just.... It’s too much wine for just us!  Oldie isn’t my dad. Oldie, wanna get drunk on wine? Looks like it’s just you and me. Remember, this is a tasting. We sort of… made this wine. It worked! It’s even better than I thought! So I said, I said - Asuka. Of course, right?! But th’ guy loves Rei, so he yells Rei! Nex’ thing I know I’m in a fistfight. Did you ev’r think we’d wind up as friends? After how we met? Sounds like you were never done with me. Fun?! Yeah. Not too much fun! Just, uh, just the right amount. Of fun. Just the right amount, though! Nothing more! We should probably all just... get to work. Hattie, could I talk to you in my office? Listen, about last night… People? Thanks, Hattie. Little busy, Jennifer. Todd and Hattie fought. They all went separate directions, and Todd fell into a trap. The Mastermind The Hacker The Muscle The Spy Yeah! Boo! We wanted forks! False advertising! Boo! Not good enough! You’re the reason hate exists! I guess that’s fine. Great, now I gotta buy all new forks. I actually think he should have to pay us. Boo! We wanted forks! False advertising! Innovative! Now that’s good business. I’ve been so excited to buy a fork! Booooo Charlatan! Get outta here! UFO sighting will happen here tonight. Z says so. You haven’t heard of Z? He’s only the most informed completely anonymous person on the internet. He’s a top commander in the secret military. If you don’t follow Z, what are you doing here? You believe what you hear on AM radio? Hey guys, this guy’s a sheep! We all came here because a genius told us to. Does that sound like a sheep to you? Z says Nickelback Peak! Haul out, free thinkers! Oh yes. Yes? Kick your odor up a notch. Smell Kick. Sideways! Not much news these days, huh? I think the power went out. Good thing I’ve got my Handy Dandy brand flashlight! No batteries in the miscellaneous drawer! And I only need one for my Handy Dandy brand flashlight! And you’ll power my Handy Dandy brand flashlight after this? What are you doing, Todd? W-Where are you going?!  What is it, Todd?  You boys trying to cheat the time loop? That’s good, clean fun. Well, we never did completely figure it out.  If a die is rolled in any of our timelines, the numbers are always different but the outcome is always the same. Right. Another one for the memories book! Casually evil. Oldie pops in I carved my own path and lived a good life. I wouldn’t have it any other way. Well, see ya! WHY IS MY ROOM FILLED WITH BOXES OF TEETH?! Thank you very much, Mrs Fish. We’ll have your computer ready by Friday. Oh, hah, yes... my mistake. We’ll have this ready for you tomorrow. THERE’S TOO MUCH WORK! But we’ll never cover costs if we don’t take all the work we can! Oh, she’s mad alright! But she’ll tire herself out soon. I’m learning some new words! WHAT IS GOING ON?! B-but aren’t you two Time Cops? Time Cops are trying to KILL me?! Can’t someone else make the toast?? Hey, nice force field! Drat! Burned it! Alright, Babs! Let’s make some cookies! Oops! Almost forgot the butter! I hope you boys are hungry! Because we ran out of eggs. These are gonna taste awful. And us! I love you, daddy. Let’s play sports together, Dad! Any sports is fine! Babies are no good anyway. What you really want in a son is a kindly old man. Isn’t that right, papa? Wanna stay over tonight, Dad?? Or forever, whatever works. Hello?? It’s … it’s been 60 years! Thank you. The basement looks great! Perfect for our first game of Figments and Fantasies! And I will be the best Game Master of all time! Just like in my fantasies. I wonder who it could be! But Todd, we need three players! Tomo metagames.  Super! Pass these character sheets around. It’s time for… Alright, everybody got their character sheets? You try to enter the local hotel, but everything appears to be locked! Because of your silly bickering, you fail to   Alright, everybody got their character sheets? Fantasies and Fabrications is going to be so fun, Todd! But Todd, we need three players! Super! Pass these character sheets around. It’s time for… You try to enter the local hotel, but the door is locked! Fixryn, you notice that a herd of monstrous-looking sheep with sharp fangs has begun to form around you. You’re no expert, but it looks like there’s only one bite hole. The three of you find yourselves inside the castle of the terrible vampire Orion! Hathildis enters to find that the terrible vampire Orion has captured Todol. Just as Orion is about to reach Hathildis, Fixryn enters! Having charmed the vampire Orion, you all sit down to tea. Hathildis and Todol chase the corrupt mogul Mr. Woolesby through the halls of the sweater emporium. A sign indicates that he’s leading you toward the Vampire Sheep Pit! And so Orion the vampire was vindicated, the wicked Mr Woolesby was defeated, and the town of Woolsmouth was saved! The group reconvene at the inn. The end. Nope! I finally finished my knife wall! No! My knife wall is ruined! Earthquake! Hide under a table! Finally, my knife wall is complete! Leave the boy alone. He’s fine! Who’s using up all the bandwidth? I thought I destroyed this photo!  I warned you two! The boy is fine. You could change Babs easily because he was an impressionable little sponge. But Spike is his own person! You need to let him make his own mistakes. Plus anime rules. Nope! O-Oh, that old thing? That’s always been there. If you say so. Getting that debt is part of the hard timeline, Todd! Sure, we can make small changes to the timeline… But that’s the soft timeline. The important stuff happens every time. That’s the hard timeline. Some people call it that. Some destinies are dumb! Well, if we pay off the minimum each month, we can pay the loan off in.... 800 years! Then it’ll be closer to… yep, eternity. Oooooh, your fancy hoodie! No stains! No way! You’re like Romeo’s sexy half-brother that Juliet leaves him for. My version’s better! Don’t you dare cancel this date. Okay! Sophie! My darling! I’ve waited all these years to see you again… All of the most amazing experiences you’ll have are but a distant memory to me now. I’d give anything to be in Todd’s shoes again, even for a mome- I will always love you! I hope you like eggs! It’s all I know how to make. They still make me do it though! What’s going on in here? Sorry, boys. Simple fact is, some things just take time. Oh my, no. In 2034 they invent beard transplants. Well, how would you like to be remembered? Ho ho, how our priorities change as we age. I’d like to be remembered for my pet portraits. Just the people I made them for. Sophie, barn cats, Mrs. Fish. Don’t worry yourself with all that, Tomo. You just focus on living a good life. No, no, no! This isn’t right at all! My art isn’t made for the masses! All that matters to me are the lives I touched along the way. Sophie, barn cats, Mrs. Fish… Which one is your favorite? Tell them they don’t need drinking water! We’re sponsored by Pipsy anyway. I’m a senator! Turns out lying is a great way to get whatever you want. Almost. Oops, gotta run. I’m holding a press conference to tell my constituents I don’t want them to die. I actually don’t care if they die. I see what’s going on here. You boys are going through the stages of grief. Denial. Anger. So this is why my void runs deeper than usual! We can’t just stay numb forever. Feeling the good times is more important than not feeling the bad ones. Now, don’t you boys have some stages of grief to get back to? Bargaining. Depression. Acceptance. Sick, eh, boys? I know just the thing. Soup and orange juice! Hattie’s apartment is heavily guarded, but the guards have one weakness... Using my power to change the order of events… ...I simply put the real card in Hattie’s hand before Todd shakes it. A few more adjustments here and there… Perfect. But, Todd! What did you do with the fake? Why not? I see what’s going on here. You’re worried about Paradox Containment Theory! Don’t worry about it so much. We all make paradoxes from time to time. What’s important is that we live responsibly and try to limit how many paradoxes we make. Besides, Paradox Containment Theory is just what some dumb book says. Nobody actually knows what happens. Snap out of it, Todd!  Paradox Control Theory is just a theory, Todd. And a lousy one, at that. In my time we believe in infinite records on infinite record players. Everybody is living every possibility! Whatever it is, maybe it’s not worth throwing everything away on a hunch. That must have been 30 years ago now... I swore I’d never disc golf again. Then I’m in. Disc golf… I haven’t heard those words smashed together in nearly 30 years. Disc golf?! Why would you think that? It got a lot more popular when they introduced style points. But since I’m from the future, I know every style innovation from the next 60 years. It’s all in the wrist. Max! It got a lot more popular when they introduced style points. This is the big time, Tomo! We’re here to entertain people. And I’m gonna give em what they want. Tomo, I can’t do this! That kid is the reason I lost in the pros 30 years ago! I do know one move, but … it’s dangerous. It worked! It didn’t work. Tomo, I can’t do this! You don’t understand! That kid is my worst rival! He’s the reason I lost in the pros 30 years ago! Yeah… yeah! You’re right! It happened again…! Yes. But this time I’m gonna do something about it. Typical Max. If I can control fire, then… GIT GUD Petey!! It’s so good to see you again, boy. Nothing’s ever been okay. Not  since the divorce. The divorce was 40 years ago! But she won’t just get over it. And she won’t just get over it! Gray hair, huh boys? Well, it happens to everyone eventually. Definitely. It’s even bigger than the one the boys and I made 60 years ago! Wait… Babs? Baaaabs! Aye. Beach day! I-it was… Itris. This one’s all you, boys. Pretty good? It’s one of my favorite albums of all time! Plus they write back! I’m already drunk on wine! What if pandas deserve to be endangered? You always wake up whenever you want, why shouldn’t I? Welcome back to conspiracy radio, AM 780. is pork made of people? Then at 9 it’s Just Asking Questions with [Name Redacted]. Followed by smoooooth jazz for the rest of the ni- What if our whole universe is actually two-dimensional, and it just looks like we exist in 3D space? I’m just asking questions here. A UFO has been spotted at Nickelback Peak. Everyone knows the government is run by secret lizard people. But are those lizard people secretly people people? I’m just asking questions he- I did it! I won the lott’ry! Jethro Dirtballer! Power on. Running system diagnostics... power core...  success… weapons systems... success... recommended update available. Attack mode activated. Attack mode activated. Attack mode double activated. A t t a c - … A t t a c-... Bewwww sfx Oh! Uh, thank you? What a monster. Who does she think she is?. So weird. We interrupt this broadcast to bring you breaking news of an attack downtown. Brian Becker is on the scene. A recent independent study found that the forks sold by Todd’s Compu-barn and Fork Outlet are technically sporks, sparking outrage amongst customers. Consumer advocates are calling it Sporkgate. Is it painful? I cast decoy and I sneak around to get closer. There isn’t much blood in ‘em. I was planning on feeding him to Cinderly. (his pet raven) CAW! Not too meaty, but I suppose you’ll make a fine little snack. WHAT! You… you’re the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen! Would you care to join me for some tea? You… you’re the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen! Oh, heavens no! I was going to let Cinderly eat you! What! That wasn’t part of the deal! Mr. Woolesby summoned me to this castle on the behalf of the villagers. He said their sheep population wasn’t bloodthirsty enough and I thought ‘okay weird,’ but I’m not a farmer so what do I know?? I may be a vampire, but still I’m a gentleman. Mr Woolesby paid me the blood for my services, fair and square! He said the villagers were all pitching in! I’m coming too. I want answers! Oh, heavens no! He’s far too small. I was planning on feeding him to Cinderly. What! This wasn’t part of the deal!! Mr. Woolesby summoned me to this castle on the behalf of the villagers. He said the sheep population wasn’t bloodthirsty enough and I thought ‘okay weird,’ but I’m not a farmer so what do I know?? Mr Woolesby paid me the blood for my services, fair and square! He said the villagers were all pitching in! I would never steal blood. How could anyone trust me after that? I was living in a narrow canyon before this! Do you know how much sun reaches the depths of a narrow canyon? I’m coming too. I want answers! I know. The spell failed. You were all the charm I needed. You fought bravely back there. Handsomely, too. What is it? You can tell me anything, Fixryn. Oh, I know. The spell failed. Silly Fixryn. You were all the charm I needed.  Captain! We’re taking on water! E6 and 5F! We know it’s you! Come out with your hands up so we can execute you and the Todd peacefully! We’ve always had a boat. Ever since those kindly fishermen saved us as a baby. Welcome to Mr. Woolesby’s Sweater Emporium! I’m sorry sir, Mr. Woolesby is in a sweater fitting with a customer. Wha- oh! You’re not vampires! Or vampire sheep! Kind travellers, I’m afraid the inn is closed until the terrible vampire Orion’s reign of terror has come to an end! That’s right! The wool economy has tanked! Handsomely monstrous! He’s even been stealing townspeople’s blood! Why, my blood got stolen just last week! I’ve been freezing ever since! And I’ll tell ya what, having your blood stolen is no joke. I’m always cold! Thank goodness for Mr. Woolesby’s Sweater Emporium! Ah, thank goodness! The Mr. Woolesby Vampire Sheep Control Group! Put it on my tab, my good man. Yeah, they’re for everyone! Beat that, Todd. Nice try, old man! Beat that, old man. Mirror 261. Nobody’s taking this win away from me. Don’t disappoint me, Max. Mama needs ten new pairs of jeans. Delivery for Todd. CAW! Oh! Um, hi. I volunteer because I want to make the world a better place. ...Are you bragging about a misdemeanor? Sophie. Nice to meet you too, Todd. And, for the record… I think it’s really cool that you spray painted a cop’s face. MY PENDANT! WHERE’S MY PENDANT?! Finally taking up the piano? Todd? Hi! Are you... a Forkco guy? Well, no thanks. I’ve got way too many forks as it is. ...Oh… Oh wow. Thank you. It’s a... family heirloom. Make it tea and you’ve got yourself a deal. Hey Todd! ...How do you know my dog’s name? Are you… okay? Will you... excuse me? Let’s suppose I did pause time… why aren’t you paused? God is such a strong word. I, like, control the flow of time or whatever. Just this dimension. Ever had a day that seems like it drags on forever? That’s me. Anomalies aren’t usually so… handsome. Do you just exist outside of time, or…? Sounds paradox-y. So, why haven’t I heard of you? Usually everyone shows up for the Christmas party, at least… Wait… you do have a time passport, right? Oh, god, please don’t tell me… what, are you some kind of time crime? It was nice knowing you, Todd. But, your very existence… we could both get locked up for ten eternities for this. Oh, Todd… Todd! I… I thought tonight we could watch all of One Piece. Being able to speed up time has its advantages. And, well... When are you going to introduce me to your other selves? Of course I do! I wanna know all of you. Especially the creepy-old-person you. It’s not everyday you get to find out exactly what you’re signing up for! You must be Oldie! Hi! This is so much better than baby pictures! Nice to meet you, Babs! Oh, I get it. If Babs likes me, does that make you like me more? Huh! Kinda creepy, if you think about it! Nice to meet you! I guess you do, being that you’re Todd, after all. So, wait. Does that mean you and I have… It begs the question… if you and I slept together now, would that technically be cheating? No guilt either way! I’m sorry, Todd. I was definitely flirting with Tomo. You gotta cut me some slack, though. This situation is confusing, to say the least. I know. I could rewind time if you want. I’ve got infinite do-overs! Everybody’s complicated. Let’s be complicated together. Well I think they’re delicious. Thank you, Oldie. Did somebody put horse blinders on the baby? Don’t you have work? I’d love to! Yeah. Ladybugs. Or I could have paused time. Lucky for us I can slow down time! This? ...My mom left it to me. In a way, yeah! But it’s not magic - only I can use it. It’s got something to do with my connection to it. And because of that, the further away I get from it, the less control I have. Bad signal. This is a little embarrassing actually. I thought it fell in with the garbage we picked up so I spent that entire afternoon picking through the dump. ...and that entire night. And the next morning. Do you have any idea how fast time moves when you can’t control it? Where did you find it, anyway? Maybe it was fate. Todd! That was just the bank.  Oh! You finally got it?? I’m so relieved, honestly. Without that, I… well, I just don’t want this to end. How’d your picture come out? Everybody always looks tired for some reason. See you tomorrow! Best hot dogs in town. ... Did they say why? I can’t be with a time crime, Todd. And the only other option would be... I understand. I’m glad you didn’t. Please. And as your friend, I’m gonna do everything I can to help you get your Time Passport. Someday. That part isn't gonna change. That part isn't gonna change. Sooo, uh… how have you been? Oh. Yeah, me too. Yeah, bros. Play some football, hit the showers. Oh, geez. Right! I’m here to help you study! Ohh, fun! Given your situation, you’ve probably seen quite a few paradoxes, right? Paradox Control Theory is a way to explain how paradoxes can occur without disrupting the flow of time. Think of this entire dimension - everything that has ever and will ever occur - like an old record. Time itself is simply the needle on the record player. So all time exists at once, but the way we experience it is linear like the needle running over the grooves of a record. And some people, like me, can control the playback. Now here’s the tricky thing. When a paradox occurs, it creates an entirely new record and replaces the one being played. Paradox Control Theory states that the old record warps and spins into uncontrollable disarray, resulting in infinite untold misery as every lifeform within it flashes excruciatingly in and out of existence. The Time Bureau has all this stuff figured out. Sure, but… A group of people live shackled in place their whole lives, facing a blank wall. They see the shadows of objects passing behind them and believe those shadows are reality, even though they don’t accurately represent the real world. Sounds like you’ve got a pretty good handle on it! What is this place? Todd, wait! What is this place? Come on, Todd. Let’s get back to studying. Sh-shouldn’t we get back to studying? Time law ain’t no joke! Todd, you can’t do this! Look, the theory… it’s really old, ok? People believe a lot of different things. I… I don’t know. Knowing you makes me wonder about a lot of things. Were you really gonna destroy your whole family to get out of a test?  Okay, take this with a grain of salt, but… It’s the exact same as this dimension but everybody has wet orbs for bananas. That’s propaganda! Today’s the big time passport exam! How ya feelin, champ? Nonsense, you got this. Remember, we gotta keep it professional once we’re in the metaverse. As an unlicensed anomaly, you’re super illegal. None of that. In here, we’re not even friends. You’re my charity case, got it? Knowing you, it won’t be easy. Right, ok. Starting… now. Alright, you take the stairs and I’ll meet you up top. You gotta have a Time Passport. We’d both get arrested if you came in here. Finally! I’ve never had to take the stairs. Was it really that hard?  Alright, let’s get to the testing office. Todd? Alright, this is the testing room. I’ve got some meetings in the city while you take your exam. Meet at the bottom when you’re finished? And good luck today. Professionally. I’m… I’m sorry! He’s… it’s for charity. His other selves are his family. No! What? No! I’m sorry. Sarg, no! You can’t just kill Todd! Sarg… Shut up. Whatever you did right doesn’t matter anymore. You thought?! You got me taken off the field, man! And do you really think you’re eligible for a Time Passport now that you’ve got a record?? Of course it does! I hate to leave it like this, but you have to go. Now. Yeah, Todd. I think it is. Please take care of Petey. Oh Petey, you’re such a good boy! No way. I’m already in enough trouble.  Oh! I’m… the new assistant. Guess I won’t get too comfortable. Aha! No…! Todd, I’m so sorry… Wait... 2019?? You lied about that anomaly you bagged. I know that anomaly. 2019 was before I even met Todd. I don’t think you did. ...Deal. Thank you! Mind if I join you? What! What’s not to like about me? Thanks. It was almost my 125th year. Hey, Food-o-mat! Hey E6. Sophie. Okay, I am definitely picking up on a vibe with you two. There you are! I, er, didn’t see you at lunch. Listen, if this is because I suggested you and your partner are interested in each other… Well, then I’m sorry and you’re welcome! Hey. their internal debate, their reckoning with Spike, and the earthquake. Wha… was... Dad here?? Wha… was... Dad here?? You’d be cute with some eyeliner. I needed some forks. I’ll see you… in hell. NARDSHIELD! I used my powers of illusion to imitate Sike. But the best part of all? MechoNeko’s power is now at my disposal. Thanks for the inspiration, nerd! Goodbye, Sike. Well I’m sorry Todd. How was I supposed to know that wouldn’t bring the power back? Hands up. Our little Babs is becoming… A teen. Our little Babs is becoming… A teen. This is dumb. No no no no no no no no no Get in. I got a lead. Well, there isn’t really any record of your parents. Ten years ago. Weird thing is, everybody who worked there is either dead or skipped town.  Good thing P.F. Mystery is an expert pickpocket. Happy Birthday, Todd. Isn’t it your birthday too? Was I … there? What’s he saying? Of course! I gotta say, having someone who already solved your problems has made you very efficient. Todd! Five computers almost went out with no timebomb virus. What’s goin’ on with you?  That’s a straight-up villain. This is business, Todd. Money doesn’t care about ethics, and if we start having scruples now there won’t be any business. Get it? Todd, wait! Are we still on for bowling Saturday? No, Mrs Crombummer… Please, you’ve been with Professor Fixit for years! Surely we can… Goodbye, Mrs Crombummer. So, Todd… how’s the job hunt? Is that so? It wouldn’t happen to be a repair shop, would it? I wouldn’t miss it for the world. What do you want? The branch is closing. You drove us out of business. Happy? Hey Margaret? Todd, there’s a problem with the virus removal. That is, I don’t think you should remove it. Think of all the business we’re losing! You’re taking on Fixit Corporation - they’ve got near-infinite resources and they fight dirty. Whatever. Todd? You here? Hey guys! Todd, you’ve met Hattie. She used to work for us, remember? What ever happened with that? Why wouldn’t it be? She used to work for us. Remember? What ever happened with that? I go into the hotel. She used to work for us. Remember? What ever happened with that? I go into the hotel. What! You have a soulmate? I want a soulmate. Uhh, guys… Hathildis, how’s that lock coming? That’s odd… Believe me, we don’t want to hurt you.  Just tell us what happened. Believe me, we don’t want to hurt you.  Well, it sounds like we need to pay this Mr. Woolesby a visit. I have to come clean about something. I cast ‘charm person’ on you. I know what I need to do. The jig is up, Woolesby! It really was. Dang, I’m booked that whole weekend. You know what? Let’s just figure this out later. See ya! Hey, Todd. Some guy from Forkco is here. It’s no big deal. Probably just some sales guy. YOU FELL FOR A PYRAMID SCHEME?! Thank you very much, Mr. Jenkins. This Forkco stuff is flying off the shelves. We stand to make more money selling forks than fixing computers! Sure. Sure. Of course. Of course, I was talking to the Forkco rep and he told me we’d make a lot more money going door to door. He’s technically my boss. Potatoes Pah-tah-toes. Just sleep on it. Debt ain’t gonna pay itself, after all. Anomalies, PFF. Probably Supernard. It’s all fake! He just makes illusions and then pretends to battle them. Stupid Supernard. Honey, I’m home! Thanks for cooking, darling! I’ll get us some forks. Oh no! We’re out of forks ... again! If only we had more forks! What the hell was that?? Sell it, man! You’ve gotta give me some JUICE if this is gonna work.  Honey, I’m home! Fine what? Cha-Ching! Another sale. Yeah, but we’re making bank. Plus you finally found Sophie! How’s that going, by the way? That’s every night this week! Sounds like things are getting pretty hot and heavy. Giant spiderdogs aren’t real! How can people not see that Supernard is just making dumb illusions and fighting them? But not for long! Because you and I, dear Richard, are gonna expose Supernard for the fraud that he is. And then everyone will love me. Here we go… It works! Eh, close enough. My good people - Supernard here is hardly super at all. He’s just tricked everyone into believing that he’s super. Ancient magic. Fine. I’ll prove it! Richard, ATTACK! Heh. See? Nothing but illusions. MWAHAHA! Richard, deactivate attack mode. No, no! DEactivate attack mode! I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry MechoNeko, be careful! This mech is super powerf- I thought I was exposing an evil supervillain. But what if I was the supervillain all along? Richard… my robot son... You gave your life… but we did it, Richard. We defeated Supernard! Supernaaaaard! MechoNeko, be careful! The mech is really powerf- Help! They’re all… well, I don’t know what this is, but I need help. Todd won’t pick up his phone! Come quick! They’re gonna eat us alive! What do we do?? Shouldn’t you know exactly what to do? You’re from the future! He’s got those eyelashes. Fold. Bringing Babs along on sales calls was brilliant, if I do say so myself. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jack. What the hell are you doing here? It’s gotta be my dad. Jack is too dumb to do this on his own. No way. I haven’t spoken to my dad in five years. We like each other best at a distance. It’s the one thing we have in common. Fine. I’ll talk to him. Bringing Babs along certainly helps move product. What the hell are you doing here? I don’t get it. Why would my dad start selling utensils all of a sudden? What? No way. I haven’t spoken to my father in five years. We both prefer it that way. It’s the one thing we have in common. Let me do the talking. Right here. Hi mom. It’s a structural nightmare. Honestly, this whole place could collapse any minute. Alright, we’re here. And, uh, this is Todd. Is Dad here? They’re a structural nightmare. Honestly, this whole place could collapse any minute. Well, here it is. Sr is stubborn and Fixit can’t relate to him. Sr offers to buy their company - but they have to agree never to sell utensils in this town again. Fixit and Todd leave the room to discuss. Babs grabs the relic. The room goes weird, Sr is in silhouette. When Fixit and Todd re-enter the room, Sr is a kid. Why’d you open a competing business across from Todd’s? Well how about not putting your own son out of a job? Twice? Never accomplished anything? I was featured in Conspiracy Man magazine twice last month! Dad, I don’t need you to like me, but… were you ever proud of me? Even once? Forget it! No, no. This is just how it is with my dad. Don’t worry, I feel my second wind coming. Yeah well if I’m a loser, that’s because you - No, I… think that’s my Dad. Uh.. don’t worry, buddy. I’m not gonna hurt you. For the first time in my life, I actually do feel like I could beat you in a fight. Hey, no, don’t be scared. You ever heard of conspiracies? Shadow governments, stuff like that? That’s what you really gotta be scared of. Check this out. Conspiracy Man magazine - that’s me. Back to… normal? What?! I can’t leave! I finally like my dad! Plus if he’s a kid, he can’t run us out of business. Maybe! Why not? So long, dad. It was nice to meet you. Who are you people?? What are you doing here? Who’s Z? I heard about a sighting here on AM radio last month. Been up here every night since. I’m not a sheep! You’re a sheep! This used to be a perfectly good UFO spot. My UFO spot! Stupid Z people! But if they always believe what Z says… Sheep, meet shepherd. Whoa, man. UFO?? Dang! Just Mechoneko. That’s where I told those Z guys to go! But I made that up...?? YOU! Did you weirdos see the UFO?? This is a restaurant sign. Yes it is! It’s the giant hamburger! You guys should seriously reconsider what you’re willing to believe. Think about it! An anonymous person on the internet? You have no idea who you’re listening to. It’s gotta be my brother Jack. He’s so dumb. There can’t be any other reason. Luckily, I’ve got a plan. First, we lure Jack to a private tour of the shark tank at the aquarium. A deviously handsome janitor ‘accidentally’ overfills the tank and, unable to contain the pressure, the tank glass breaks. The sharks devour Jack within seconds. I invited her. She liked the plan. We lure Jack to the shark tank at the aquarium.  I knew it! I knew Jack was the one running those ads! What about Jack? Excuse me, which way to the great white sharks? How can you not have great white sharks?! Wha- I- Can’t make it tonite, got an emergency exorcism. Sry, c u at work. Looks like you had fun last night. Oooookay. Well my exorcism was not fun, I’ll tell you that.  First, this kid starts screaming. I’m not possessed! I’m not possessed! Now obviously that’s exactly what a possessed person would- You mentioned. It’s my fault, really. I shouldn’t have trusted you with so much responsibility. Todd’s Compu-Barn and Fork Outlet. Rustiest forks in town - guaranteed! Todd’s Compu-Barn and Fork Outlet. What’s that smell? We’ll never tell! Aw nuts. 12 hours later… First edition ChibiNeko holo misprint with alt colors. The rarest MechoNeko card. And there I was, about to score one of my very own. Outta nowhere, a distraction. Hattie. She swiped the card from right under my nose. I was mad. Real mad. So she offered me a deal. Said if I can manage to steal the card from her apartment, I can keep it. No strings attached. But getting in will be no small task. Hattie lives on the 30th story in Lockdown Heights - also known as the Alcatraz of downtown penthouses. No unwanted guests. As if that weren’t enough, the safe where she keeps the card is the least accessible home safe ever invented. if Todd trusts Hattie I saw the angry mob and at first I thought ‘that’s silly,’ but now I’ve been out here three hours. So I guess I’m in it now. I’M RDY TO WTCH SM DSC GLF NW THTS WHT I CALL SPRTS! KDS YNGR’N A BASEBLL FRSH OUT THE PCKG! I heard she was in love with an anomaly. IT IS TIME FOR YOUR COMMUTE SECURE THE TOASTER! EAT IT, PIGS! That toast you were about to make sets in motion a series of events that lead to the Time Revolution. The Time Alliance wants to assassinate you to prevent it from ever happening. Not anymore. We joined the rebellion when we found out we were the same person. Roger. Thanks, Captain. Pfff, whaaaaaaat? M-maybe I put the wrong date by mistake. F-Fine! I lied. He’s still there. It’s… complicated. But look, your friend is safe as long as nobody finds out about this, right? So let’s both just keep it quiet. Deal? Err… Look, no offense, but I’m new here and people do not like you. See, that! Thanking bots? It’s creepy! So Old Earth. Probably on the field too long. Bound to take a toll on a person. If you’re gonna sit here, you gotta be cool. I have a reputation to establish. Yo. This is my partner, 5F. Yeah, later. 5F and I are professionals. PROFESSIONALS! You were right. It’s a weird situation. I guess I just wasn’t ready to admit it to myself. Hey, Sophie! Orion and Todol I always had you boys. Tomo metagames. Tomo is leaning in from behind the panel, outside, flipping Oldie off. You wouldn’t believe me if I told ya. Obviously! Now for the best part of my plan. Now for the best part of my plan. I think I’d remember that, Tomo. I can’t believe you think you’re gonna meet your soulmate as a door-to-door fork salesman. No offense, but your latest album is surprisingly unoriginal and bland. Didn’t you clean up? You Todd? Interdimensional mail. I just deliver the interdimensional mail, kid. Todd’s birthday Call the hospital. Please take care of Petey.
