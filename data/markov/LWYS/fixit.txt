Get in. I got a lead. 
Well, there isn't really any record of your parents. 
Ten years ago. Weird thing is, everybody who worked there is either dead or skipped town.  
Good thing P.F. Mystery is an expert pickpocket. 
Happy Birthday, Todd. Isn't it your birthday too? 
Was I ' there? What's he saying? Of course! 
I gotta say, having someone who already solved your problems has made you very efficient. 
Todd! Five computers almost went out with no timebomb virus. What's goin' on with you?  
That's a straight-up villain. 
This is business, Todd. Money doesn't care about ethics, and if we start having scruples now there won't be any business. Get it? 
Todd, wait! Are we still on for bowling Saturday? 
No, Mrs Crombummer - Please, you've been with Professor Fixit for years! 
Surely we can. Goodbye, Mrs Crombummer. 
So, Todd' how's the job hunt? 
Is that so? It wouldn't happen to be a repair shop, would it? 
I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
What do you want? The branch is closing. You drove us out of business. Happy? Hey Margaret? 
Todd, there's a problem with the virus removal. That is, I don't think you should remove it. 
Think of all the business we're losing! 
You're taking on Fixit Corporation - they've got near-infinite resources and they fight dirty. 
Todd, you've met Hattie. She used to work for us, remember? 
What ever happened with that? Why wouldn't it be? She used to work for us. Remember? What ever happened with that? 
I go into the hotel. She used to work for us. 
What! You have a soulmate? I want a soulmate. 
Uhh, guys' Hathildis, how's that lock coming? 
That's odd. Believe me, we don't want to hurt you. Just tell us what happened.
Believe me, we don't want to hurt you.  
Well, it sounds like we need to pay this Mr. Woolesby a visit. 
I have to come clean about something. I cast 'charm person' on you. 
I know what I need to do. 
The jig is up, Woolesby! 
It really was. Dang, I'm booked that whole weekend. You know what? Let's just figure this out later. See ya! 
Hey, Todd. Some guy from Forkco is here. It's no big deal. Probably just some sales guy. 
YOU FELL FOR A PYRAMID SCHEME?! 
Thank you very much, Mr. Jenkins. 
This Forkco stuff is flying off the shelves. We stand to make more money selling forks than fixing computers! 
Sure. Sure. Of course. Of course, I was talking to the Forkco rep and he told me we'd make a lot more money going door to door. He's technically my boss. 
Potatoes Pah-tah-toes. Just sleep on it. Debt ain't gonna pay itself, after all. 
Anomalies, PFF. Probably Supernard. It's all fake! He just makes illusions and then pretends to battle them. Stupid Supernard. 
Honey, I'm home! Thanks for cooking, darling! I'll get us some forks. Oh no! We're out of forks ... again! If only we had more forks! What the hell was that?? 
Sell it, man! You've gotta give me some JUICE if this is gonna work. 
Honey, I'm home! Fine what? Cha-Ching! Another sale. Yeah, but we're making bank. Plus you finally found Sophie! How's that going, by the way? 
That's every night this week! Sounds like things are getting pretty hot and heavy. 
Giant spiderdogs aren't real! How can people not see that Supernard is just making dumb illusions and fighting them? 
But not for long! Because you and I, dear Richard, are gonna expose Supernard for the fraud that he is. And then everyone will love me. 
Here we go' It works! Eh, close enough. 
My good people - Supernard here is hardly super at all. He's just tricked everyone into believing that he's super. Ancient magic. 
Fine. I'll prove it! Richard, ATTACK! Heh. See? Nothing but illusions. MWAHAHA! Richard, deactivate attack mode. No, no! DEactivate attack mode! 
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry MechoNeko, be careful! This mech is super powerf- 
I thought I was exposing an evil supervillain. But what if I was the supervillain all along? 
Richard, my robot son... You gave your life' but we did it, Richard. We defeated Supernard! Supernaaaaard! 
MechoNeko, be careful! The mech is really powerf-Help! 
They're all' well, I don't know what this is, but I need help. Todd won't pick up his phone! 
Come quick! They're gonna eat us alive! What do we do?? 
Shouldn't you know exactly what to do? You're from the future!
He's got those eyelashes. Fold. 
Bringing Babs along on sales calls was brilliant, if I do say so myself. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jack. What the hell are you doing here? 
It's gotta be my dad. Jack is too dumb to do this on his own. 
No way. I haven't spoken to my dad in five years. We like each other best at a distance. It's the one thing we have in common. 
Fine. I'll talk to him. 
Bringing Babs along certainly helps move product. 
What the hell are you doing here? 
I don't get it. Why would my dad start selling utensils all of a sudden? 
What? No way. I haven't spoken to my father in five years. We both prefer it that way. It's the one thing we have in common. 
Let me do the talking. Right here. 
Hi mom. It's a structural nightmare. Honestly, this whole place could collapse any minute. 
Alright, we're here. And, uh, this is Todd. Is Dad here? They're a structural nightmare. 
Honestly, this whole place could collapse any minute. 
Well, here it is. 
Sr is stubborn and Fixit can't relate to him. Sr offers to buy their company - but they have to agree never to sell utensils in this town again. 
Why'd you open a competing business across from Todd's? 
Well how about not putting your own son out of a job? Twice? 
Never accomplished anything? I was featured in Conspiracy Man magazine twice last month! 
Dad, I don't need you to like me, but' were you ever proud of me? Even once? Forget it! 
No, no. This is just how it is with my dad. Don't worry, I feel my second wind coming. Yeah well if I'm a loser, that's because you - No, I' think that's my Dad. 
Uh.. don't worry, buddy. I'm not gonna hurt you. 
For the first time in my life, I actually do feel like I could beat you in a fight. 
Hey, no, don't be scared. You ever heard of conspiracies? Shadow governments, stuff like that? That's what you really gotta be scared of. 
Check this out. Conspiracy Man magazine - that's me. 
Back to' normal? What?! I can't leave! I finally like my dad! Plus if he's a kid, he can't run us out of business. 
Maybe! Why not? So long, dad. It was nice to meet you. 
Who are you people?? What are you doing here? Who's Z? 
I heard about a sighting here on AM radio last month. Been up here every night since. 
I'm not a sheep! You're a sheep! This used to be a perfectly good UFO spot. My UFO spot! Stupid Z people! 
But if they always believe what Z says' Sheep, meet shepherd. 
Whoa, man. UFO?? Dang! Just Mechoneko. 
That's where I told those Z guys to go! But I made that up...?? 
YOU! Did you weirdos see the UFO?? This is a restaurant sign. Yes it is! It's the giant hamburger! 
You guys should seriously reconsider what you're willing to believe. Think about it! An anonymous person on the internet? You have no idea who you're listening to. 
It's gotta be my brother Jack. He's so dumb. There can't be any other reason. 
Luckily, I've got a plan. First, we lure Jack to a private tour of the shark tank at the aquarium. 
A deviously handsome janitor 'accidentally' overfills the tank and, unable to contain the pressure, the tank glass breaks. 
The sharks devour Jack within seconds. I invited her. She liked the plan. We lure Jack to the shark tank at the aquarium.  
I knew it! I knew Jack was the one running those ads! What about Jack? 
Excuse me, which way to the great white sharks? How can you not have great white sharks?! 
Wha- I- Can't make it tonite, got an emergency exorcism. Sry, c u at work. 
Looks like you had fun last night. Oooookay. 
Well my exorcism was not fun, I'll tell you that. First, this kid starts screaming. I'm not possessed! I'm not possessed! 
Now obviously that's exactly what a possessed person would- You mentioned.  
I can't believe you think you're gonna meet your soulmate as a door-to-door fork salesman.  
Whaaaaaaaaaaat. Just tell us what happened. Not so fast, Supernard. 
Then he'll just tell them to go aways. 
Todd, this is Margaret Fixit from corporate. Margaret is here to proctor your A- certification. 
The mandatory exam I told you to study for two weeks ago. 
AHA! I knew it! You're cheating! ...Right. You, from tomorrow' ...Sure... Of course. ...But if Tomo is Todd from tomorrow' who is Todd tomorrow? 
If Todd exists in Day 0 then Tomo exists in Day 1, but Tomo exists in Todd's Day 0 TODD! 
Todd' why don't you take the day off? But why didn't Tomo tell him he had the day off? 
But if he never came in he'd never know he had the day off. 
Okay well in the many-worlds interpretation' I GOT IT! You two DO make sense! 
In quantum theory, every possible outcome of an event exists in its own universe. 
So every time someone makes a decision, the universe splits to accommodate every possible outcome. 
But Todd's universes split twice for every outcome. For every decision, there is a Todd and a Tomo. 
Because our Todd calls the shots in this timeline, let's call him Todd Prime.
Whenever Todd Prime makes a decision, the Tomo we know is immediately pulled from the universe in which that decision was made.  
There are infinite versions with every possible outcome from every possible Todd. 
I call it the Time Lasagna. Todd is the noodles, and Tomo is the meaty sauce. 
What are YOU doing here? W-Who are you? 
Hah, oh. Totally. Ok, this is creepy. 
I can shut the system down if I can get this to the compu- Bernard! Bernard! Put the CD in the drive! Bernard? 
Futurenard, If Todd exists in Day 0 then Tomo exists in Day 1, but Tomo exists in Todd's Day 0 TODD! 
Todd, why don't you take the day off? But why didn't Tomo tell him he had the day off? 
But if he never came in he'd never know he had the day off. 
Okay well in the many-worlds interpretation' I GOT IT! You two DO make sense! 
Now let's see here. Ah yes, here it is! Krk'l'thmiskrim, God of Fissures K'lm kathar m'r'lagthmgal bal'mranarba... What? No. I'm just reading the instructions. 
Got any tape? 
WELL CITIZEN, IT SEEMS THIS EVIL HAS BEEN VANQUISHED! IF YOU EVER AGAIN HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE OCCULT OR PARANORMAL... YOU KNOW WHO TO CALL! AWAYYY!! 
I-It's a side hustle. LOOK, YA' DO WHAT YA' GOTTA DO IN THIS ECONOMY. 
Relax, I'm a professional. 
Hey, get outta here!! Get outta here! 
It's a little self-improving computer! It may not look like much, but it's actually twice as smart as it was yesterday! 
Yep! Look, it even attached an antenna to itself. That wasn't there before! 
Haha, but that's just a pet project of mine. We've got real work to do. 
Come take a look at this laptop a client brought in. 
O-Oh, Hello Todd... Tomo? You're not Todd?? Mornin', Todd! Mornin', Todd...  
The perfect spot, for the perfect shot. For the perfect proof, that there are 2 Todds. But so far there's just this old man...    
What? But I've traced your dad's name back to the nuclear power plant.    
Everybody' except our informant.    
No. You're safe with us.    
Look, calm down. We just need some information. An address.    
So? This place ring any bells?    
Where are you going?    
Don't forget to infect that machine with the timebomb virus. Old lady Crombummer is a good client.    
Directly competing with Professor Fixit, perhaps?    
Oh you know your targeted ads?    
You gotta make sure to uncheck advertise to friends I'm betraying    
Yeah... This is the last of it. EAT IT.    
I think I know the perfect place.    
What are you all doing in here? Who's Mr Woolesby?    
Can I have a look at that bite?    
Richard, my only friend'    
But at least I defeated that damnable Supernard.        
One thing I know about my dad is that he's a stubborn old goat. If he's trying to drive us out of business, he's not gonna stop. 
Mystery is like jazz, Todd. Most people are bad at it.
